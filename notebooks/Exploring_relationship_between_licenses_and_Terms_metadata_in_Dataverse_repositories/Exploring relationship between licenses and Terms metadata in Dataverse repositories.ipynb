Some repositories allow anyone to publish datasets and don't intervene at all or in all cases to prevent datasets that have conflicting metadata. At the other end, some repositories have complete control. The level of control and expertise applied when publishing datasets should be taken into account if a goal of this \"multiple licenses\" work is to add functionality that helps depositors with any level of curation expertise easily apply Terms metadata easily that follows best practices for data sharing."
