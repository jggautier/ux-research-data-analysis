Therefore, caution should be exercised when presenting deviating results, in particular with regards to staffing levels of local administrations and state-related companies. Furthermore, the questionnaires were translated from German to French and Italian. Hence, it is possible that some of the questions might have been understood differently among the respondents from the different language regions. Misunderstandings can also not be ruled out completely with regards to certain technical terms. Depending on the level of knowledge or the degree to which a municipal secretary is affected by a specific topic, answering some of the questions could have been a challenge for some informants. These aspects must be considered when conducting data analyses. "

The User, owners of the Materials are the consortium members of the SILNE and SILNE-R projects.

Materials 	
(Short description) 	The database includes data obtained during the performance of two social whole-network surveys in 67 secondary schools in Europe. It contains data obtained at different levels: at the student-level, at the school-level, at the dyad-level and finally a dataset at the staff-level.

III. Use of the Materials
Use of the Materials include but are not limited to viewing parts or the whole of the content included in the Materials; comparing data or content from the Materials with data or content in other Materials; verifying research results with the content included in the Materials; and extracting and/or appropriating any part of the content included in the Materials for use in other projects, publications, research, or other related work products.
1.	Representations
In Use of the Materials, Downloader represents that:
1.	Downloader is not bound by any pre-existing legal obligations or other applicable laws that prevent Downloader from downloading or using the Materials;
2.	Downloader will not use the Materials in any way prohibited by applicable laws;
3.	Downloader has no knowledge of and will therefore not be responsible for any restrictions regarding the use of Materials beyond what is described in this Agreement; and
4.	Downloader has no knowledge of and will therefore not be responsible for any inaccuracies and any other such problems with regards to the content of the Materials and the accompanying citation information.
B. Restrictions in his/her Use of the Materials, Downloaders cannot:
1.	obtain information from the Materials that results in Downloader or any third party(ies) directly or indirectly identifying any research subjects with the aid of other information acquired elsewhere;
2.	produce connections or links among the information included in User’s datasets (including information in the Materials), or between the information included in User’s datasets (including information in the Materials) and other third-party information that could be used to identify any individuals or organizations, not limited to research subjects; and
3.	extract information from the Materials that could aid Downloader in gaining knowledge about or obtaining any means of contacting any subjects already known to Downloader.
IV. Representations and Warranties
User represents that user has all rights required to make available and distribute the materials. Except for such representation, the materials is provided “as is” and “as available” and without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and any warranties implied by any course of performance or usage of trade, all of which are expressly disclaimed.

Annex 1 : Data access rules and publication rules for SILNE survey (first and second wave) 
 
 
Revised, December 2018 
 
 
The aim of this document is to propose a general template for rules on data access and publication regarding the first and second wave of the SILNE-survey (survey coordinator Vincent Lorant) that have been creates in the SILNE and SILNE-R projects (project coordinator Anton Kunst). These are rules are not only meant to avoid dispute, but also to stimulate collaborative, comparative analyses. They are based on the rules that have been developed for the first wave of the SILNE survey.

A. General 
 
1. The WP leader and representatives of the seven countries (Belgium, Finland, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal and Ireland) are called below “partners”. 
 
2. This agreement fully adheres to the SILNE-R Consortium Agreement (CA), including its articles on data ownership, data access rights, and dissemination. 
 
3. The agreement also takes into account the ethics requirements and data management rules specified for SILNE-R by the Horizon2020 program. 
 
4. This agreement assumes that partners adhere to existing rules on good scientific practice.  

B. Access to and use of SILNE data sets by partners 
 
5. The data of the seven countries are considered as one single data set, to be used for collaborative, international analyses.  
 
6. Data sets containing data from the 7 countries will be developed, maintained and upgraded by the WP leader.  
 
7. After validation and preliminary analyses, the WP leader will ensure a smooth transfer of relevant data sets, together with documentation, to other partners.  
 
8. The partners will not use the data sets for any other purposes than for research or feedback to respondents such as schools.

C. Access to and use of SILNE data sets by third parties 
 
9. “Third parties” include everyone not affiliated with the department (or other organizational units of similar size) of one of the partners.

10. Students at bachelors or masters levels may use the data for research, provided that they join the team of one of the partners and work at the partner’s premises. 
 
11. Before July 2020, partners will not give third parties access to the data unless agreed by all partners. Request to access the data will be decided by the “Publication Group” (see point 17 below).   
 
12. From July 2020 onwards, the data will be accessible to third parties.These par",Non applicable,See DSA,"Lorant, Vincent; Kunst, Anton; Rimpelä, Arja; Richter,Matthias; Federico, Bruno; Clancy, Luke; Perelman, Julian; Robert,Pierre-Olivier; Grard, Adeline; Melard, Nora, 2020, ""SILNE/SILNER surveys, wave 1 and wave 2"", https://doi.org/10.14428/DVN/K9MDBK, Open Data @ UCLouvain,",See DSA,See DSA,Non applicable
