</p><p>Scoring information. The following data step performs the necessary transformations to the thirty-seven raw scale sums of the Gough Adjective Check List. Procedures for doing the transformations are also described by Swede, l983. Three quantities necessary for the transformation were calculated separately for males and females. The mean and standard deviation of each scale were determined. The correlation of the first scale (number of adjectives checked) with each of the other scales was
calculated. The appropriate male or female value for these quantities was then used to transform each respondent's rating for each scale. The respondent's raw scale value was standardized by subtracting that scale's mean and dividing by the scale's standard deviation. The variance due to the number of adjectives checked was partialled out (Nunnally, 1967) by subtracting the product of the standardized scale times the correlation of that scale with the number of adjectives checked from the
standardized scale. The adjusted scale was restandardized by dividing by the square root of one minus the correlation squared (the variance remaining in the scale after the variance due to number of adjectives has been removed). this result was converted to a T-score (mean=50, standard deviation=10.0, and zero correlation with number of adjectives checked) by multiplying times ten and adding fifty.

The effect of the project was assessed in a “before-after and intervention-comparison” comparative framework. The baseline and endline data were compared between six randomly selected intervention districts and three comparison districts. The data on LAPM use were collected from 5,864 randomly selected currently married women of reproductive age during February-May 2013 both from the intervention and comparison districts. These data were compared with those obtained through the 2010 Bangladesh Maternal Mortality Survey, which was conducted during January-August 2010 in the six intervention and three comparison districts.  Additionally, in 2013, data on provider skills and practices were collected from 627 government family planning workers from the six intervention districts and three comparison districts. The findings provide policy guidance for the promotion of LAPM in Bangladesh.",

The population-based survey consisted of a national sample of 1943 households, 97% of which responded. Individual response rates among eligible men and women were 92% and 96%, respectively. This 95-page report summarizes the ZSBS findings. Some key findings: virtually all respondents had heard of AIDS, and 86% of men and 78% of women thought that HIV infection could be avoided. Two-thirds of men and 57% of women agreed that condom use was an effective prevention method. Only 7% of respondents thought it was acceptable for a married man to have extra-marital sexual relations, but 19% of men and 29% of women thought a man could not be sexually satisfied with just one partner. One in five adults were estimated to be HIV positive by 1995; however, few people knew their HIV status, and many held negative attitudes about HIV-positive people. Sexual behavior in Zambia had not changed drastically from 1996 to 1998, though unmarried men did report fewer partners. Close to one-third of men reported using condoms in non-marital relationships, a slight decrease from 1996.

In this study, we examine the acute effects of EtOH on electrically evoked dopamine release and clearance in the mPFC of anesthetized rats naïve to alcohol or chronically exposed to alcohol during adolescence.<br>
METHODS:<br>
Dopamine release and clearance was evoked by electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and measured in the mPFC of anesthetized rats with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. In Experiments 1 and 2, effects of a high dose of EtOH (4 g/kg, intraperitoneally) on dopamine neurotransmission in the mPFC of EtOH-naïve rats and rats given EtOH exposure during adolescence were investigated. Effects of cumulative dosing of EtOH (0.5 to 4 g/kg) on the dopamine release and clearance were investigated in Experiment 3. Experiment 4 studied effects of EtOH locally applied to the VTA on the dopamine neurotransmission in the mPFC of EtOH-naïve rats.<br>
RESULTS:<br>
A high dose of EtOH decreased evoked dopamine release within 10 minutes of administration in EtOH-naïve rats. When tested via cumulative dosing from 0.5 to 4 g/kg, both 2 and 4 g/kg EtOH inhibited evoked dopamine release in the mPFC of EtOH-naïve rats, while 4 g/kg EtOH also slowed dopamine clearance. A similar effect on electrically evoked dopamine release in the mPFC was observed after infusion of EtOH into the VTA. Interestingly, intermittent EtOH exposure during adolescence had no effect on observed changes in mPFC dopamine release and clearance induced by acute EtOH administration.<br>
CONCLUSIONS:<br>
Taken together, these data describe EtOH-induced reductions in the dynamics of VTA-evoked mPFC dopamine release and clearance, with the VTA contributing to the attenuation of evoked mPFC dopamine release induced by EtOH.

After 2005 the health variables were no longer constructed. In the absence of detailed documentation, the variable labels in each data set describe the contents of the variables.  The number of observations in each data set does not necessarily match the total number of observations in the original data files. For the economics da
ta sets, filter criteria were established so that only families with complete economic information were included. The health data sets used the maximum number of non-missing observations per individual analysis. Thus, the health data sets vary in composition more than do the economics ones.

2027,https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/12165,,"Foundational studies in political science endeavored to explain the dynamics of voter turnout in America over time. Two theories, one focused on legal-institutional factors and the other on behavioral elements such as party mobilization strategies, were born from the need to account for temporal fluctuations in aggregate voter turnout. A comprehensive test of these competing theories has been hindered by the fact that reliable measures of the behavioral factors driving turnout have proven elusive. In this paper I develop and test an interactive theory of voter turnout that focuses on the impact of legal-institutional barriers to the franchise conditional on party organizational strength and mobilization efforts. To this end I employ data on the circulation of party-sponsored newspapers, coupled with information on the spread of voter registration requirements, to capture the effects of both behavioral and legal-institutional factors in Pennsylvania between 1876 and 1948. My results offer modest empirical support for an interactive theory of aggregate voter turnout. In isolation, however, the effects of behavioral factors are quite limited. On the other hand, legal-institutional variables exert a sizeable impact on voter turnout in the state. Contrary to other recent work on the subject, careful analysis of the Pennsylvania case therefore provides a great deal of evidence in favor of legal-institutional accounts of the changes in aggregate voter turnout that were witnessed at the beginning of the 20th century, while at the same time demonstrating that behavioral factors, such as the decline of the partisan press, served to enhance the del

Using a widely-distributed anesthesia calculator app as a platform, we were interested in assessing worldwide regional restrictions on the use of sugammadex, which is a drug used for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade. We were sought to obtain a crowdsourced measure of adverse event incidence associated with sugammadex administration and compare it to traditionally-derived estimates.  Using Anesthesiologist, an anesthesiology reference and calculator mobile application (app), we surveyed anesthesia providers in 187 countries regarding restrictions on sugammadex availability, barriers to sugammadex usage, and experience with adverse events. Cost restrictions were analyzed by region and country income level. A low and high-end incidence of adverse events was estimated based on respondents’ frequency and duration of sugammadex use.  Cost concerns were common while concerns about adverse events were rare. Regional and income-related variability in restrictions due to cost was observed. Providers in high-income countries were more likely to have access to sugammadex (p = 0.01) and to report cost-restrictions on sugammadex use (p = 0.002). The estimated incidence of anaphylaxis due to sugammadex was 1:1,000-1:20,000. Use of an in-app survey facilitated a global survey of anesthesia providers and could have useful applications in monitoring adverse events and trends in medication usage.We conclude that there is significant variability in the rate at which cost concerns drive provider behavior worldwide. These may arise from differences in health care systems and in the relative drug costs for sugammadex versus alternative reversal agents. ",2017-05-10

<b>Rationale</b> Early onset of alcohol drinking has been associated
with alcohol abuse in adulthood. The neurobiology of this
phenomenon is unclear, but mesolimbic dopamine pathways,
which are dynamic during adolescence, may play a role.<br>
<b>Objectives</b> We investigated the impact of adolescent bingelike
alcohol on phasic dopaminergic neurotransmission during
adulthood.<br>
<b>Methods</b>
Rats received intermittent intragastric ethanol, water,
or nothing during adolescence. In adulthood, electrically
evoked dopamine release and subsequent uptake were measured
in the nucleus accumbens core at baseline and after
acute challenge of ethanol or saline.<br>
<b>Results</b>
Adolescent ethanol exposure did not alter basal measures
of evoked dopamine release or uptake. Ethanol challenge
dose-dependently decreased the amplitude of evoked
dopamine release in rats by 30–50 % in control groups, as
previously reported, but did not alter evoked release in
ethanol-exposed animals. To address the mechanismby which
ethanol altered dopamine signaling, the evoked signals were
modeled to estimate dopamine efflux per impulse and the
velocity of the dopamine transporter. Dopamine uptake was
slower in all exposure groups after ethanol challenge
compared to saline, while dopamine efflux per pulse of electrical
stimulation was reduced by ethanol only in ethanolnaive
rats.<br>
<b>Conclusions</b> The results demonstrate that exposure to binge
levels of ethanol during adolescence blunts the effect of ethanol
challenge to reduce the amplitude of phasic dopamine
release in adulthood. Large dopamine transients may result
in more extracellular dopamine after alcohol challenge in
adolescent-exposed rats and may be one mechanism by which
alcohol is more reinforcing in people who initiated drinking at
an early age.

- This package includes a newer airports inventory from 2017 NEI than was used in the 
  original 2017gb emissions case. This newer version, which was not available until after the 2017gb emissions case was completed in May 2020, corrects an overestimation of emissions from airports.
- This package includes average speed distributions (SPDIST) from 2017. The original 2017gb emissions case used average speed distributions from 2016. This is an input to SMOKE-MOVES and affects the ""RPD"" category of onroad emissions.

The purpose of the NHIS is to obtain information about the amount and distribution of illness, its effects in terms of disability and chronic impairments, and
the kinds of health services people receive. Information is obtained on the number of restricted-activity days, bed days, work- or school-loss days, and all physician visits occurring during the 2-week period prior to the week of the interview. Data are also obtained on the acute and chronic conditions that were responsible for these days or visits. Respondents are asked about long-term limitation of activity and the chronic conditions related to this disability. All conditions are coded according to the Health Interview Survey Medical Coding Manual and Short Index, a modified version of the International Classification of Diseases, using the limited diagnostic detail available from a household respondent. Data are obtained on all hospital episodes during the prior 12 months, including length of stay and whether surgery was performed. The data files from the basic module are: Household, Family, Person, Sample Adult, Sample Child, Immunization, Injury/Poison Episode, and Injury Verbatim. Those respondents who served as sample a

This paper explores this “pseudo-paradox”, and argues that the answer can be found in partisan redistricting.  Through an analysis of forty years of congressional elections, we find that partisan gerrymanders induce greater competitiveness as national tides increases, largely due to unanticipated consequences of waves adverse to the map-drawing party, particularly in seats held by that party.  The phenomenon anecdotally coined by Grofman and Brunell as the “dummymander” is thus actually quite common and has significant effects on rates of congressional competition nationally.  In contrast, bipartisan maps are shown to induce lower competition, while nonpartisan maps induce higher competition, under all electoral conditions and competitiveness measures.  But the effects of partisan gerrymanders on competition, while strong, can only be seen in interaction with short-term national forces.",2016

The placenta, as a mediator of the maternal and fetal systems and a regulator of development, is an ideal tissue to understand the biological pathways underlying relationships between season of birth and later life health outcomes. Here, we conducted a differential expression (DE) analysis of season of birth in full‐term human placental tissue to evaluate whether the placenta may be influenced by seasonal cues. Of the analyzed transcripts, 583 displayed DE between summer and winter births (False Discovery Rate [FDR] q < .05); among these, BHLHE40, MIR210HG, and HILPDA had increased expression among winter births (Bonferroni P < .05). Enrichment analyses of the seasonally variant genes between summer and winter births indicated overrepresentation of transcription factors HIF1A, VDR, and CLOCK, among others, and of GO term pathways related to ribosomal activity and infection. Additionally, a cosinor analysis found rhythmic expression for approximately 11.9% of all 17 664 analyzed placental transcripts.

The survey serves as the endline for the Community Participation for Action in the Social Sector (COMPASS) Project. The survey was implemented in the local government areas (LGAs) in the states of Bauchi, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Kano, Lagos, and Nasarawa where COMPASS is being implemented. COMPASS represents the integration of three previous U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID/Nigeria) funded projects: VISION, BASICS, and LEAP.  The purpose of COMPASS is to enhance reproductive health and family planning services as well as to promote child survival and improved literacy. The core idea behind COMPASS is to integrate the health and education sectors through the promotion of community coalitions. From a representative sample of men and women in the COMPASS target areas, the survey obtained information on all health facilities reportedly used by the sample of respondents.  Information was collected on the facility background; vaccine logistic systems; child health services; antenatal and postpartum care; newborn and delivery care; sexually transmitted infection (STI) and voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services; and select medications.  The objective of this report is to present a set of indicators that are used by COMPASS and USAID for monitoring and evaluating program performance. Data from this end-of-project survey will be used to measure changes in health service indicators in the LGAs served by the COMPASS Project. Further, the results of the end-of-project survey may be used to redirect efforts or increase levels of intervention in selected areas based on the needs and goals of the health facilities in COMPASS project areas. Chapter 1 presents an overview of healthcare facilities. Chapter 2 describes facility characteristics, including service provision, facility amenities, outreac

These effects are measured by a variety of means: detailed monitoring of individuals' health status and dietary intake, precise measurement of household-level expenditures and service utilization, and collection of relevant community-level data, including
region-specific prices and community infrastructure data. Phase II data have been collected annually (with two exceptions) since 1994. The project has been run jointly by the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, headed by Barry M. Popkin, and the Demoscope team in Russia, headed by Polina Kozyreva and Mikhail Kosolapov.
</p>  <b>Please note</b> <p>The sample size in 2014 was cut by about 20%, because the cost of the project increased due to inflation, but financial support remained the same. The original 1994 sample remained the same, and all cuts applied only to the part of the sample which was added in 2010. It should be stated that the implemented procedure of cutting the sample size guarantees that the smaller sample is still representative at the national level. To lower the cost it was also decided to dro

</p>   <b>Household Data</b> <p>For the household interview, a single member of the household was asked questions that pertained to the entire family. The respondent was usually the oldest living woman in the home since she was available to be interviewed during the daytime.

Thus, the interviewer was instructed to speak with ""the person who knows the most about this family's shop

In practice, however, some individuals, such as very young children and elderly people, did not receive an individual interview.

(Pre-lab baseline measures were completed by N = 134 people.)
<br>
<br>
Participants were eligible if they were at least 24 years old, cohabiting with the romantic partner, not taking antidepressants or been recently diagnosed with depression or an anxiety disorder; women were ineligible if they were over 40, postmenopausal, pregnant (or planning to become pregnant during the study), within 6 months postpartum (lactating), or have had an oopherectomy; men were ineligible if they were taking steroid medication. 
<br>
<br>
On average, participants were 29 years old (range 23 – 53), had been involved in their romantic relationship for more than 5 years; the majority were married (58%) or engaged to be married (11%). Most identified as White/Caucasian (78.4%) and non-Hispanic (99%).
<br>
<br>
Participants independently completed a 30 minute online questionnaire in the days prior to their first lab session. The couple attended the lab session together. There, we took baseline recordings of physiological activity while they independently completed a few well-being measures. Participants were then randomly assigned to have one of two types of structured conversations: express gratitude to the partner for something the partner had done for them, or discussion of their day so far (i.e., mundane things their partner might not have heard about yet; “Events of the day” conversation). The structure of the task was as follows: couple-members independently took a couple of minutes to consider what they would discuss; then one couple-member led a conversation on the assigned topic, which was immediately followed by brief online questionnaires independently completed by each person; the 2nd couple-member then led a conversation and they again independently completed brief online questionnaires about it. Psychophysiology was assessed during each conversation and a small saliva sample was collected after each conversation. At the end of the lab session, the couple learned more about the tasks for the forthcoming month.
<br>
<br>
For the next month (28 nights), couple-members independently completed a brief nightly questionnaire about their day (including personal well-being and interactions with the partner). In addition, they were told they would be randomly signaled a handful of times in the morning (i.e., receive an email) prompting them to set aside time that evening to have a conversation on the general topic they had discussed in the lab (e.g., express gratitude for something new or discuss the events of the day, respectively). (Couples completed 5 such conversations, on average, over the month.) They independently completed brief online questionnaires about those conversations by the next morning.
<br>
<br>
Four weeks after the first lab session, the couple returned to the lab and completed the same measures and procedures as well as compliance, willingness to be recontacted, and consent to use transcripts and videos/images in various contexts in the future.

A single stage cluster sampling procedure was used to randomly select 33 communities or barangays (17 urban, 16 rural) from the Metropolitan Cebu area. The barangays, which contained about 28,000 households, were completely surveyed in late 1982 and again in early 1983 to locate all pregnant women. Women of the selected barangays who gave birth between May 1, 1983, and April 30, 1984, are included in the sample. A baseline interview was conducted among 3,327 women during the 6th to 7th month of pregnancy so that all births, including preterm births, could be identified. Subsequent surveys took place immediately after birth, then at bimonthly intervals for 24 months. From the baseline sample, there were 3,080 nontwin live births. Approximately 2,600 households were studied intensively for the full 2 years. Each survey collects detailed health, nutrition, demographic, and socioeconomic data.
<br/><br/> Individual, household, and community data were collected during the baseline survey. Detailed community surveys of health and family planning facilities, health personnel (modern and traditional), and commercial establishments selling infant foods were undertaken on a periodic basis. A birth information survey was conducted to obtain information about the delivery and to determine birth weight, gestational age (including clinical assessment of low birth weight infants, infants of mothers with diabetes, and infants of mothers with no last menstrual period data). The bimonthly longitudinal surveys obtain dietary, morbidity, anthropometry, infant care, family planning, and related data. Water quality tests were conducted repeatedly over an 18-month period for all types of barangay and household water sources, and an analysis of household sources of water consumed by infants was obtained for a subsample of infants. The same subsample was used to study the etiology of diarrhea. A detailed description of this stage of the field work is provided in the Survey Procedures document.",

31086,https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/TUIJBE,,"- 20 students of the Erasmus University Rotterdam in The Netherlands (11 women, 9 men, mean age 21.8 yrs, range 18-34) volunteered to participate. Only participants who were in love with someone of the opposite sex were included in the study. Other inclusion criteria were normal or corrected-to-normal vision, no diagnosis and no medication use. All participants were right-handed.
<br><br>
- Participants were in love, so the type of relationships were romantic relationships. The data is from individuals. <br><br>
- Participants provided the two pictures of their beloved and friend prior to the testing session. These pictures were scanned, scaled to gray and resized to 200*250 pixels. At the testing session, the participants first gave informed consent. Second, the participants filled out a questionnaire about the duration and intensity of their love for the beloved, and the duration of any relationship with the beloved. Furthermore, they were asked to rate the attractiveness of the people on the three pictures (beloved, friend and unknown (fe)male) on a 9 point Likert scale (Likert, 1932). Similarly, the participants were asked how much they were in love with these people. Third, the participants filled out a Dutch translation of the Passionate Love Scale (PLS by Hatfield & Sprecher, 1978, in Hatfield, 1998). Fourth, the participants filled out a hand preference questionnaire (Van Strien, 1992). Finally, they completed a Dutch translation of the Affect Intensity Measure (AIM by Larsen, 1984, in Larsen & Diener, 1987). Next, the electrodes were placed, during which the experimenter asked the participants to remember pleasant, but not sexual events that had occurred with their beloved and friend. Furthermore, some instructions were given regarding limiting movement, eye blinks and tension of face and neck muscles during testing. During testing the participants sat in a comfortable chair in a soundproof, dimly-lit room. Participants completed an ERP task, and those data are published in Langeslag, Jansma, Franken, & Van Strien, 2007, Biological Psychology). The current data set involves an EEG task, because those data have not been published. Written instructions appeared on the screen, which the participants could read in their own pace. The participants were asked to focus on a fixation cross for 30 sec. This time interval was determined by short tones. These data served as a measure for the baseline condition. The remainder of the procedure of the EEG study resembled that of the fMRI study of Fisher and colleagues (2003). The participants were instructed to think about the pleasant event with their beloved or friend as their pictures appeared on the screen. Research has shown that viewing a pictures of a beloved and thinking back to specific relationship events are a good ways to elicit intense experiences of attraction (Mashek, Aron & Fisher, 2000). Furthermore, participants were instructed that they would have to count backwards aloud in steps of seven from a number (such as 5401) that appeared on the screen. This Serial Countback Task served as a distraction task to decrease carry-over effects, i.e. to erase feelings caused by the previous pictures (Mashek et al., 2000). The participant viewed the beloved for 30 sec, followed by the distraction task for 40 sec. Furthermore, the participants viewed the friend for 30 sec followed by 40 sec of the distraction task. This sequence was repeated 5 times. Halfway there was a break, after which the participants could continue by pressing a button. The total duration of the EEG study was approximately 14 min. Whether the beloved or the friend was the starting image, was balanced between participants. To make sure that the quality of the pictures of the beloved was no different from that of the pictures of the friends, these pictures were rated by men and women who did not participate in the two studies. They were recruited among students and employees of the Erasmus University Rotterdam and friends of the experimenter. Ten women (mean age 22.4, range 19-25) rated the 23 pictures of male faces (11 beloved, 11 friends and 1 unknown male) that were used in the main study. Similarly, ten men (mean age 22.2, range 19-30) rated the 19 pictures of female faces (9 beloved, 9 friends and 1 unknown female). For each pictures the men and women indicated how attractive they found that person on a 9 point Likert scale (Likert, 1932). Besides, they indicated whether they knew the person on the pictures. If they did know the person on a pictures, their attractiveness rating of that pictures was discarded from analyses. The stimulus protocol was programmed using E-Prime V1.1 (Psychology Software Tools, 2002). The EEG was recorded using a 32-channel amplifier and data acquisition software ActiveView (both BioSemi, ActiveTwo System). Sampling rate was 512 Hz. The Ag-AgCl ‘Pintype’ Active electrodes were fixed upon the scalp according to the 10-20 International System, by means of a headcap (BioSemi) and highly conductive electrode gel (Signa, Parker). Vertical electro-oculogram (VEOG) and horizontal electro-oculogram (HEOG) were recorded by attaching additional electrodes (UltraFlat Active electrodes, BioSemi) respectively above and below the left eye, and at the outer canthus of both eyes. The electrodes were attached to the skin by means of two-sides adhesive disks and highly conductive electrode gel (Signa, Parker). In the same way, reference electrodes were attached to the left and right mastoids. The EEG measurements were time locked to the stimuli by recording a trigger at the same time as the stimulus.<br><br>

To do so, there is a need to develop a mapping strategy that is rigorous enough to detect low levels of ongoing transmission while also using resources efficiently. A multi-country operational research study was conducted comparing sampling in purposively-selected communities, random sampling in randomly-selected communities, and random sampling in the schools in which the majority of children from the randomly-selected villages attended. In Malawi, quota sampling was used in purposively selected communities. Three districts were included in the study: Chitipa, Dedza, and Karonga. Chitipa had never previously undergone treatment with ivermectin, whereas Dedza and Karonga had previously undergone ivermectin/albendazole treatment for lymphatic filariasis. In Chitipa, the highest prevalence in a purposively-selected community was 0% by Ov16 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and 2% by SD Bioline Ov16 ELISA, whereas the mean prevalence from random sampling was 0.1% by RDT and 5% by ELISA. In Dedza, the highest prevalence in a purposively-selected community was 2% by RDT and 36% by ELISA, whereas the mean prevalence from random sampling was 0.6% by RDT and 7% by ELISA.

Traditional accounts posit that attitudes toward redistribution are driven by economic self-interest or ideological principles. From a social psychological perspective, however, we expected that subjective comparisons to others may be a more relevant form of self-interest than material wealth. We hypothesized that participants would support redistribution more when they felt low in subjective status than when they felt high, even when actual resources and self-interest were held constant. Moreover, we predicted that people would legitimize these shifts in policy attitudes by appealing selectively to ideological principles concerning fairness. In four studies we found correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Studies 2 - 4) evidence that subjective status motivates shifts in support for redistributive policies along with the ideological principles that justify them.",2014-09-09

31169,https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/D9ZUIB,,"While most Americans appear to acknowledge the large gap between the rich and the poor in the U.S., it is not clear if the public is aware of recent changes in income inequality. Even though economic inequality has grown substantially in recent decades, studies have shown that the public's perception of growing income disparities has remained mostly unchanged since the 1980s. This research offers an alternative approach to evaluating how public perceptions of inequality are developed. Centrally, it conceptualizes the public's response to growing economic disparities by applying theories of macro-political behavior and place-based contextual effects to the formation of aggregate perceptions about income inequality. It is argued that most of the public relies on basic information about the economy to form attitudes about inequality and that geographic context---in this case, the American states---plays a role in how views of income disparities are produced. A new measure of state perceptions of growing economic inequality over a 25-year period is used to examine whether the public is responsive to objective changes in economic inequality. Time-series cross-sectional analyses suggest that the public's perceptions of growing inequality are largely influenced by objective state economic indicators and state political ideology. This research has implications for how knowledgeable the public is of disparities between the rich and the poor, whether state context influences attitudes about inequality, and what role the public will have in determining how expanding income differences are addressed through government policy.",2017-02-10

These effects are measured by a variety of means: detailed monitoring of individuals' health status and dietary intake, precise measurement of household-level expenditures and service utilization, and collection of relevant community-level data, including
region-specific prices and community infrastructure data. Phase II data have been collected annually (with two exceptions) since 1994.

The original 1994 sample remained the same, and all cuts applied only to the part of the sample which was added in 2010. It should be stated that the implemented procedure of cutting the sample size guarantees that the smaller sample is still representative at the national level.

Heeding their call, this paper builds an original dataset of over 5,000 pieces of state-level legislation addressing issues that span the ideological spectrum. It compares proposals that challenge the authority of the national government in a specific domain to proposals that lack federalism-related implications and finds that the former, all else being equal, make less legislative progress towards enactment. In addition, it categorizes the measures that resist national laws based on the specific nature of the challenge they pose. Its analysis finds that measures that are inconsistent with existing national law but work within the law’s legal framework make more legislative progress than measures that seek to nullify the national law or that vow not to cooperate with it. It also confirms that sponsor characteristics such as majority status, the number of cosponsors, institutional rules such as hearing requirements, and state-level factors like party control of the state legislature affect how much progress proposals make toward enactment. Thus, the paper demonstrates the importance of legislative content as an explanatory factor and sheds light on the nature of intergovernmental relations in the contemporary United States.",

However, OLS is easily influenced by outliers and thus can produce misleading results when the error term distribution has heavy tails. Here we demonstrate that median regression (MR), an alternative to OLS that conditions the median of the dependent variable (rather than the mean) on the independent variables, can be a solution to this problem. Then we propose and validate a hypothesis test that applied researchers can use to select between OLS and MR in a given sample of data. Finally, we present two examples from state politics research in which (1) the test selects MR over OLS and (2) differences in results between the two methods could lead to different substantive inferences.

We offer a new way to conceptualize status quo orientation in ballot measure elections. Specifically, we argue that opposition arguments are more effective than support arguments because of the well-known framing negativity bias and not because the starting position for uninformed voters is to default to no. We present the results of two survey experiments to test the impact of support and opposition arguments in ballot initiative campaigns.

Fewer than four percent of these respondents graduated prior to 2003. Programs with multiple degrees were able to select the degree programs included in their sample. The graduates received an email invitation and three email reminders.  A few programs mailed paper invitations to encourage better response rates.   The response rate for the survey was 41% (n=3507).

This is because psycholinguistic effects are often dependent on relatively small differences in response times, and there is substantial doubt as to whether precise timing measurements can be gathered over the web. Here we show that three classic psycholinguistic effects can in fact be replicated using AMT in combination with open-source software for gathering response times client-side. Specially, we find reliable effects of subject definiteness, filler-gap dependency processing, and agreement attraction in self-paced reading tasks using approximately the same numbers of participants and/or trials as similar laboratory studies.

BACKGROUND
Tobacco, alcohol, and sugar consumption contribute to cancer burden. An evidence-based population-level intervention to reduce intake of tobacco, alcohol, and sugar-added products is the implementation of policies that increase their price. This can be done through excise taxes, mitigation fees, bans on discounts, and minimum prices. Yet, the adoption of these evidence-based policies has received only limited traction, and public support is undermined by industry-led efforts to oppose policy interventions. This proposal is guided by a working hypothesis that public acceptance of different tax and non-tax pricing interventions for cancer risk behaviors varies by: (a) policy type, (b) the way the message is framed, and (c) the cancer-causing product it addresses.
<p>
AIMS
We examine this working hypothesis through specific aims to: (1) identify and optimize ways to communicate price policy options for cancer-causing products to the public and (2) explore the effects of policy type, frames, and behavioural domain on public policy support.
<p>
PARTICIPANTS
Participants in the interview stage (qualitative) will be: 6 members of the public, 6 cancer survivors, and 6 cancer policy advocates – half of each stakeholder group will be in each country. Participants in the quantitative study will be solicited by Qualtrics's Survey Panels service (n=1800).
<p>
METHODS
This project will use a mixed-methods approach to understand the framing of tax and non- tax pricing policy interventions to reduce consumption of cancer-causing products. We will conduct formative qualitative research with stakeholders, identify frames to test, and pilot the frames in a quantitative study. We will then implement a 3x3x4 factorial experiment to assess the impact of the frames, cancer-causing products discussed, and pricing policy options on support for policies among UK and US adults.",2019-04-12

I argue that a state’s bureaucratic capacity to gather data—distinct from its analytical capacity—is necessary for public officials to acknowledge failure, highlighting the impact of policy and institutional design on evidence-based policymaking and policy corrections.",2021-01-08

<br>
Ghana was selected as the site for YouthSave's experimental study and impact assessment. Conducted by a team of researchers from the United States and Ghana, the Ghana Experiment investigated the viability of youth savings accounts and their potential effects on youth development outcomes, including financial, economic, education, health, and psychosocial well-being. The experiment sought to address critical gaps in research, knowledge, and practice in the field of youth financial inclusion in low and middle-income countries. The Ghana experiment was implemented in partnership with HFC Bank, the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) at University of Ghana, and the Global Social Development Innovations (GSDI) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
<br>
<br>
The Ghana Experiment used a multi-stage sampling and a cluster randomized design with two treatment conditions and one control condition. Additionally, 50 schools were randomly assigned to the treatment conditions, and the other 50 schools to the control condition. Among the 50 treatment schools, 25 schools were randomly assigned to treatment condition 1 (i.e., savings account marketing outreach), and the other 25 schools to treatment condition 2 (i.e., in-school banking services plus marketing outreach). The sample comprised an initial cohort of 6,252 and an additional cohort of 2,000 junior high school students and their parents. For the original cohort, at least 60 to 62 students were randomly selected from each school to participate in the study. For the new cohort, at least 20 students were randomly selected from each school. Baseline data were collected from the original cohort in August 2011 and the new cohort in September 2013. Follow-up data collection happened for both cohorts from July to August 2014.
<br>
<br>
With a mandate from the central bank of Ghana, HFC Bank created a tailored youth savings account targeted to youth aged 12 to 18 years and operated as a custodial account. The account was to marketed to schools in treatment condition 1 and 2. Additionally, students in treatment condition 2 were allowed make school-based savings deposits.

These files usually contain more years of data, more geographic areas, and/or more categories of subjects than those shown in the Acrobat version. The extensive selection of statistics is provided for the United States, with selected data for regions, divisions, states, metropolitan areas, cities, and foreign countries from reports and records of government and private agencies. Software on the disc can be used to perform full-text searches, view official statistics, open tables as
Lotus worksheets or Excel workbooks, and link directly to source agencies and organizations for supporting information. Except as indicated, figures are for the United States as presently constituted. Although emphasis in the Statistical Abstract is primarily given to national data, many tables present data for regions and individual states and a smaller number for metropolitan areas and cities.Statistics for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and for island areas of the United States are included in many state tables and are supplemented by information in Section 29. Additional information for states, cities, counties, metropolitan areas, and other small units, as well as more historical data are available in various supplements to the Abstract. Statistics in this edition are generally for the most recent year or period available by summer 2006. Each year over 1,400 tables and charts are reviewed and evaluated; new tables and charts of current interest are added, continuing series are updated, and less timely data are condensed or eliminated. Text notes and appendices are revised as appropriate. This year we have introduced 72 new tables covering a wide range of subject areas. These cover a variety of topics including: learning disability for children, people impacted by the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast area, employees with alternative work arrangements, adult computer and Internet users by selected characteristics, North America cruise industry, women- and minority-owned businesses, and the percentage of the adult population considered to be obese. Some of the annually surveyed topics are population; vital statistics; health and nutrition; education; law enforcement, courts and prison; geography and environment; elections; state and local government; federal government finances and employment; national defense and veterans affairs; social insurance and human services; labor force, employment, and earnings; income, expenditures, and wealth; prices; business enterprise; science and technology; agriculture; natural resources; energy; construction and housing; manufactures; domestic trade and services; transportation; information and communication; banking, finance, and insurance; arts, entertainment, and recreation; accommodation, food services, and other services; foreign commerce and aid; outlying areas; and comparative international statistics.""

BACKGROUND
Tobacco, alcohol, and sugar consumption contribute to cancer burden. An evidence-based population-level intervention to reduce intake of tobacco, alcohol, and sugar-added products is the implementation of policies that increase their price. This can be done through excise taxes, mitigation fees, bans on discounts, and minimum prices. Yet, the adoption of these evidence-based policies has received only limited traction, and public support is undermined by industry-led efforts to oppose policy interventions. This proposal is guided by a working hypothesis that public acceptance of different tax and non-tax pricing interventions for cancer risk behaviors varies by: (a) policy type, (b) the way the message is framed, and (c) the cancer-causing product it addresses.
<p>
AIMS
We examine this working hypothesis through specific aims to: (1) identify and optimize ways to communicate price policy options for cancer-causing products to the public and (2) explore the effects of policy type, frames, and behavioural domain on public policy support.
<p>
PARTICIPANTS
Participants in the interview stage (qualitative) will be: 6 members of the public, 6 cancer survivors, and 6 cancer policy advocates – half of each stakeholder group will be in each country. Participants in the quantitative study will be solicited by Qualtrics's Survey Panels service (n=1800).
<p>
METHODS
This project will use a mixed-methods approach to understand the framing of tax and non- tax pricing policy interventions to reduce consumption of cancer-causing products. We will conduct formative qualitative research with stakeholders, identify frames to test, and pilot the frames in a quantitative study. We will then implement a 3x3x4 factorial experiment to assess the impact of the frames, cancer-causing products discussed, and pricing policy options on support for policies among UK and US adults.",2019-04-12

angladesh has invested in a maternal health program with support from a number of development partners. Committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5, Bangladesh’s targets are to reduce the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to 143 per 100,000 live births by 2015, and to increase skilled attendance at birth to 50 percent by 2016. In the last decade, the health, nutrition, and population sector program of Bangladesh has adopted a national strategy for maternal health focusing on Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) for reducing maternal mortality, focusing especially on early detection and appropriate referral of complications, and improvement of quality of care. Since 2001, the government embarked on program to retrain existing government community health care workers as Community Skilled Birth Attendants (CSBA) as the primary operational strategy for achieving the 2015 target of 50 percent skilled attendance at birth.
</p>  <p>The second Bangladesh Maternal Mortality and Health Care Survey was conducted in 2010 (BMMS 2010) with the major objectives being to provide a maternal mortality estimate for the period 2008-2010, to determine whether MMR has significantly declined from 1998-2001, and to ascertain the causes of maternal death. The first such national level survey was conducted in 2001 (BMMS 2001).</p>  <p>The survey was carried out in a national sample of 175,000 households, interviewing ever-married wo

However, these studies focus exclusively on policy adoption, neglecting whether or not ideological preferences also govern the extent to which local actors choose to cooperate with federal immigration initiatives. To account for this shortcoming, I use zero-inflated negative binomial regression to assess county-level deportations resulting from local participation in the Secure Communities program. I find that existing financial and structural resources as well as financial incentives are strong determinants of county deportation levels. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that conservative counties produce more deportations. Instead, the size of a county’s policing budget moderates the relationship between ideological orientations and deportation outcomes. With federal-local policy partnerships on the rise, these findings provide an important foundation for developing a better framework to understand the implications of such partnerships for policy implementation. In short, this paper suggests that while policy adoption may be a politicized process, local compliance with federal initiatives is highly dependent on the resource constraints and incentives of the actors involved.",2015

In this paper, we use co-sponsorship data from 74 state legislative chambers from 2011-2014 to analyze the collaborative patterns of female legislators. We find that female legislators are more collaborative than men, and that this collaborative advantage is greater in chambers where women are systematically excluded from positions of influence.

The project built on WILIS 1, a comprehensive IMLS funded study of career patterns of graduates of LIS programs in North Carolina. WILIS 2 builds on WILIS 1 by fully developing and testing the career tracking model on a national level. The WILIS 2 survey was designed for recent graduates of LIS programs in North America.  The survey gathered data on demographics, employment, LIS Master’s Program experience and evaluation and knowledge and skills provided by the LIS Program. 39 LIS programs participated in the study. Programs were asked to select a random sample of 250 of their master’s degree graduates from the previous five years; however, several programs included a few graduates from earlier years. Fewer than four percent of these respondents graduated prior to 2003. Programs with multiple degrees were able to select the degree programs included in their sample. The graduates received an email invitation and three email reminders.  A few programs mailed paper invitations to encourage better response rates.   The response rate for the survey was 41% (n=3507). Response rates for individual programs ranged from 16 % to 80%.  The dataset of the 39 LIS programs includes alumni that graduated between 2000 and 2009.",2012

However, these studies focus exclusively on policy adoption, neglecting whether or not ideological preferences also govern the extent to which local actors choose to cooperate with federal immigration initiatives. To account for this shortcoming, I use zero-inflated negative binomial regression to assess county-level deportations resulting from local participation in the Secure Communities program. I find that existing financial and structural resources as well as financial incentives are strong determinants of county deportation levels. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that conservative counties produce more deportations. Instead, the size of a county’s policing budget moderates the relationship between ideological orientations and deportation outcomes. With federal-local policy partnerships on the rise, these findings provide an important foundation for developing a better framework to understand the implications of such partnerships for policy implementation. In short, this paper suggests that while policy adoption may be a politicized process, local compliance with federal initiatives is highly dependent on the resource constraints and incentives of the actors involved.",2015

YouthSave was a 5-year research project that investigated the potential of savings accounts as a tool for youth development and financial inclusion in low and middle-income countries. Supported by the MasterCard Foundation, and implemented in Colombia, Ghana, Kenya, and Nepal, YouthSave was led by Save the Children in partnership with the Center for Social Development at Washington University in St. Louis (CSD), New America, and the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP). Ghana was selected as the site for the YouthSave’s large-scale, experimental study and impact assessment.

<br>
Ghana was selected as the site for YouthSave's experimental study and impact assessment. Conducted by a team of researchers from the United States and Ghana, the Ghana Experiment investigated the viability of youth savings accounts and their potential effects on youth development outcomes, including financial, economic, education, health, and psychosocial well-being. The experiment sought to address critical gaps in research, knowledge, and practice in the field of youth financial inclusion in low and middle-income countries. The Ghana experiment was implemented in partnership with HFC Bank, the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) at University of Ghana, and the Global Social Development Innovations (GSDI) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
<br>
<br>
The Ghana Experiment used a multi-stage sampling and a cluster randomized design with two treatment conditions and one control condition. Additionally, 50 schools were randomly assigned to the treatment conditions, and the other 50 schools to the control condition. Among the 50 treatment schools, 25 schools were randomly assigned to treatment condition 1 (i.e., savings account marketing outreach), and the other 25 schools to treatment condition 2 (i.e., in-school banking services plus marketing outreach). The sample comprised an initial cohort of 6,252 and an additional cohort of 2,000 junior high school students and their parents. For the original cohort, at least 60 to 62 students were randomly selected from each school to participate in the study. For the new cohort, at least 20 students were randomly selected from each school. Baseline data were collected from the original cohort in August 2011 and the new cohort in September 2013. Follow-up data collection happened for both cohorts from July to August 2014.
<br>
<br>
With a mandate from the central bank of Ghana, HFC Bank created a tailored youth savings account targeted to youth aged 12 to 18 years and operated as a custodial account. The account was to marketed to schools in treatment condition 1 and 2. Additionally, students in treatment condition 2 were allowed make school-based savings deposits.

Within these two large areas, the researchers have attempted to integrate concepts such as boundaries, closeness, coalitions, decision-making, family power, negotiation style and role relationships. The extent to which a family is adaptable means how flex
ible the family is in areas such as role relationships and power, while cohesion is defined as the emotional bonding of family members for each other. The scale has 30 items which are answered on a scale from 1-5. Two scores are obtained, one for adaptability and one for cohesion. Based on comparisons with the norm groups for a family's score on these two dimensions, the family can be scored on a circumplex model involving 16 different family types. Generally, family members are asked to complete the questionnaires for both real and ideal family, but for the purposes of this CAPS study, only the real family (actual) descriptions were obtained.

Many, if not most of these migrants, who are generally possessed of low human and financial capital on arrival in the city, will settle in slums, the areas of concentrated poverty and environmental vulnerability that are already a dominant feature of much of the urban landscape of the developing world. Bangladesh will be no exception to these trends. The growth in her urban population is set to outstrip by a wide margin that in rural areas. Moreover, the urban growth already experienced in recent decades demonstrates that slums will likely be an increasingly important feature of urban existence in Bangladesh. Anticipating these developments, USAID and the Government of Bangladesh tasked a research team based in Bangladesh and the United States (at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) with conducting a survey designed to obtain a broad health profile of the urban population of Bangladesh.

c relationships.</p><p>In the second part, Rs are asked to indicate whether their responses to an attitudes toward love scale will refer to a current relationship, a past relationship, or how they think they would react (if they've never had a romantic relationship). They then complete the Love Attitudes Scale, developed by Clyde and Susan Hendrick (1986), which has six subscales:</p><p>Eros: Strong physical preferences, early attraction, and intensity of emotion are attributes of erotic love, a
long with strong commitment to the lover. Love is highly valued by Eros types.
</p><p>Ludus: Love as an interaction game to be played out with diverse partners appears to be the main attribute of Ludus types. Deception of the lover is acceptable within proper role limits. There is not great depth of feeling. The Ludic lover is wary of emotional intensity from others. Ludic love has a manipulative quality, resulting in apparent lower social desirability.</p><p>Storge: This style reflects an inclination to merge love and friendship. There is no fire in storgic love. It is so
lid, down-to-earth, and presumably enduring. Storge items reflect an 'evolutionary' vs 'revolutionary' emphasis.
</p><p>Pragma: Rational calculation with a focus on desired attributes of the lover is central to pragmatic love. 'Love planning' might be an apt description. This type uses criteria matching.</p><p>Mania: 'Symptom love' based on uncertainty of self and the lover. May be most characteristic of adolescents, but there are examples of this type in adults.</p><p>Agape: This is an all-giving, nondemanding love.</p><p>Next, respondents complete a Relationship Satisfaction Questionnaire about their rom
antic relationship (if they have one). Three subscales are derived from this measure: Total, Dyadic Cohesion, Dyadic Satisfaction.
</p><p>If the respondent has indicated (in another unit, SIGOTH) having a current romantic relationship, they then complete the Interpersonal Processes Scale, in which the boy/girlfriend's name is used as a stimulus.</p><p>If the respondent has indicated (in another unit, SIGOTH) having a current best opposite-sex friend, they then complete the Interpersonal Processes Scale, in which the friend's name is used as a stimulus.</p><p>In both cases, the Interpersonal Process Scale is scored to produc

The survey collected data on the educational and career histories of respondents, as well as data related to demographics, specific jobs held, breaks in employment, continuing education, opinions about trends in LIS, satisfaction with LIS as a career and perspectives of recent graduates about their LIS programs and entry into the workforce. Respondents were asked to identify up to five specific jobs in terms of the following categories: job immediately before their LIS program, job immediately after their LIS program, current job or last job depending on employment status, longest job and highest-achieving job.

I find that conservative Republican state parties are more likely to pass legislation enhancing immigration enforcement—on the condition that the Republican Party controls the state’s legislative institutions. However, the willingness of Republican controlled legislatures to pass immigration reform is often tempered by electoral concerns. Republican controlled legislatures in states where Latinos make up a large proportion of the electorate are significantly less likely to adopt new legislation that targets undocumented migrants. I argue that Republican support for increasing sanctions on undocumented migrants is eroded by the potential for an electoral backlash from Latino voters. Democratic controlled legislatures are unlikely to pass legislation under any conditions. Ultimately, the observed pattern of policy adoption is the product of the tradeoff between the state parties’ ideologically driven policy goals and the electoral consequences associated with actually implementing immigration policies.",

We extend this literature by assessing the effects on voter turnout of collective descriptive representation in U.S. state legislatures on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, and their intersections. We argue that members of historically excluded groups respond to the overall composition of their state’s legislature. We test this proposition in seven elections (2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012). Our results are consistent with the minority empowerment literature, as overall collective representation does substantially increase turnout among previously excluded groups. However, the impact varies intersectionally. For white women, gender trumps race, as higher collective gender representation, regardless of race or ethnicity, increases voter turnout. For African Americans, race trumps gender, as both black men and women respond most consistently to higher levels of collective racial representation. For Latinos, we find less consistent results, but note a collective ethnic turnout effect for 2002 and 2006. We conclude that collective representation, especially at the intersection of identities, is an important factor influencing levels of turnout among previously excluded groups.",

Further, recent research shows that the Court more frequently declares state statutes unconstitutional than federal statutes.  However, only a limited number of studies have extensively explored this political phenomenon.  One aspect of a state that has not been considered in connection with the Supreme Court’s use of judicial review over state legislation is the electoral environment in which the laws are produced.  We argue that because electoral competition affects the legislative output from a state, it could also influence the likelihood that a state has a statute invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court.  When examining all states between 1971 and 2010, we find evidence in support of our theoretical expectation.  Specifically, we find that an increase in electoral competition corresponds to an increased likelihood that a state has a statute invalidated by the Supreme Court. This finding contributes to our understanding of the Supreme Court’s use of judicial review, and it also suggests that electoral pressure can incentivize states to craft unconstitutional public policy.",2018-01-29

Part 1 built an in-depth understanding of educational, workplace, career and retention issues faced by LIS graduates using the life course perspective from the social sciences. This part of the research was sited in North Carolina where a full range of LIS program types exist. One of the programs is in a historically Black institution, allowing a focus on minority career and retention issues. Part 2 used the methods developed in Part 1 to generate a transferable model for career tracking of LIS graduates nationally.  In Part 1, the study developed a comprehensive web-based survey to collect data on the long term career patterns of those who graduated from LIS programs in North Carolina.  The survey collected data on the educational and career histories of respondents, as well as data related to demographics, specific jobs held, breaks in employment, continuing education, opinions about trends in LIS, satisfaction with LIS as a career and perspectives of recent graduates about their LIS programs and entry into the workforce. Respondents were asked to identify up to five specific jobs in terms of the following categories: job immediately before their LIS program, job immediately after their LIS program, current job or last job depending on employment status, longest job and highest-achieving job.

However, these courts generally cannot enforce their rulings, which begs the question: how effective are international courts? This book proposes a general theory of international courts that assumes a court has no direct power over national governments. Member states are free to ignore both the international agreement and the rulings by the court created to enforce that agreement. The theory demonstrates that such a court can, in fact, facilitate cooperation with international law, but only within important political constraints. The authors examine the theoretical argument in the context of the European Union. Using an original data set of rulings by the European Court of Justice, they find that the disposition of court rulings and government compliance with those rulings comport with the theory's predictions.",

At the beginning of the event, participants completed a pre-survey with several demographic and individual difference measures (e.g., attachment, Big 5, destiny/growth, Sociosexual Inventory, Fear of Being Single, anticipated reactions to rejection/acceptance, motivations for speed-dating, approach/avoidance motivations, menstrual cycle information, etc.). Their photos were taken prior to the event commencing. <br> <br>

Then after each date during the speed-dating event, participants responded to a questionnaire reflecting their impressions of that dater (e.g., physical attractiveness, how selective the dater is, self-expansion motivation, perceptions of attachment style, perceptions of partner's interest, etc.). Importantly, each dater indicated whether or not they would like to share their contact information (when both daters mutually agree to share contact information, this is considered a ""match"".) <br> <br>

A few hours after the event, participants received their matches. In two samples (2013) they received a brief survey asking their positive and negative emotions regarding their matches, rejections, and missed opportunities. <br> <br>

In one sample (2015), participants were followed up every week for 12 weeks, to assess whether they had made contact with their matches, and track any budding relationships. <br> <br>

These effects are measured by a variety of means: detailed monitoring of individuals' health status and dietary intake, precise measurement of household-level expenditures and service utilization, and collection of relevant community-level data, including
region-specific prices and community infrastructure data. Phase II data have been collected annually (with two exceptions) since 1994.

The original 1994 sample remained the same, and all cuts applied only to the part of the sample which was added in 2010. It should be stated that the implemented procedure of cutting the sample size guarantees that the smaller sample is still representative at the national level.

BACKGROUND
Tobacco, alcohol, and sugar consumption contribute to cancer burden. An evidence-based population-level intervention to reduce intake of tobacco, alcohol, and sugar-added products is the implementation of policies that increase their price. This can be done through excise taxes, mitigation fees, bans on discounts, and minimum prices. Yet, the adoption of these evidence-based policies has received only limited traction, and public support is undermined by industry-led efforts to oppose policy interventions. This proposal is guided by a working hypothesis that public acceptance of different tax and non-tax pricing interventions for cancer risk behaviors varies by: (a) policy type, (b) the way the message is framed, and (c) the cancer-causing product it addresses.
<p>
AIMS
We examine this working hypothesis through specific aims to: (1) identify and optimize ways to communicate price policy options for cancer-causing products to the public and (2) explore the effects of policy type, frames, and behavioural domain on public policy support.
<p>
PARTICIPANTS
Participants in the interview stage (qualitative) will be: 6 members of the public, 6 cancer survivors, and 6 cancer policy advocates – half of each stakeholder group will be in each country. Participants in the quantitative study will be solicited by Qualtrics's Survey Panels service (n=1800).
<p>
METHODS
This project will use a mixed-methods approach to understand the framing of tax and non- tax pricing policy interventions to reduce consumption of cancer-causing products. We will conduct formative qualitative research with stakeholders, identify frames to test, and pilot the frames in a quantitative study. We will then implement a 3x3x4 factorial experiment to assess the impact of the frames, cancer-causing products discussed, and pricing policy options on support for policies among UK and US adults.",2019-04-12

The spreadsheet files, which are available in both Excel and Lotus formats, will usually have more information than the tables displayed in the book or Adobe Acrobat files. This year the Census introduced almost 100 new tables covering a wide range of subject areas. The Census reinstated a smaller version of the Industrial Outlook Section (now 31) and has included a separate section (32) with 21 summary industry tables from the 1997 Economic Census based on the North American Industry Classification system (NAICS). Other new tables cover such topics as prescription drug sales, public school building conditions, charter schools, distance education, HMOs, income-tested benefits, employment projections, household debt, mutual fund ownership, commercial industry space revenue, hazardous material shipments, bridge conditions, home remodeling, firearms manufactures, and e-commerce sales. For a complete list of new tables, see Appendix VI. The disc also includes content not found in the book such as a special new section featuring early population results from the 2000 census for states, metropolitan areas, large cities, and counties. PDFs providing more explanation of several major economic series including the Federal Budget, the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), and the new North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

Yet, this research on the dominance of the affluent has overlooked key partisan differences in the electorate.  In this era of hyper-partisanship, we argue that representation occurs through the party system, and we test whether taking this reality into account changes the story of policy dominance by the rich. We combine data on public preferences and state party positions to test for income bias in parties’ representation of their own co-partisans.  The results show an interesting pattern in which under-representation of the poor is driven by Democratic parties pushing the more liberal social policy stances of rich Democrats and Republican parties reflecting the particularly conservative economic policy preferences of Rich Republicans. Thus, we have ample evidence that the wealthy, more often than not, do call the shots, but that the degree to which this disproportionate party responsiveness produces less representative policies depends on the party in power and the policy dimension being considered. We conclude by linking this pattern of influence and “coincidental representation” to familiar changes which define the transformation of the New Deal party system.[insert article abstract]",2019-04-19

Here I show evidence of that bias and offer a potential solution. Through Monte Carlo simulation of an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model, I compare conventional standard error (OLS-SE) and RCSE performance to that of a bootstrap method that resamples clusters of observations (BCSE).

The survey serves as the endline for the Community Participation for Action in the Social Sector (COMPASS) Project. The survey was implemented in the local government areas (LGAs) in the states of Bauchi, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Kano, Lagos, and Nasarawa where COMPASS is being implemented. COMPASS represents the integration of three previous U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID/Nigeria) funded projects: VISION, BASICS, and LEAP.  The purpose of COMPASS is to enhance reproductive health and family planning services as well as to promote child survival and improved literacy. The core idea behind COMPASS is to integrate the health and education sectors through the promotion of community coalitions. From a representative sample of men and women in the COMPASS target areas, the survey obtained information on all health facilities reportedly used by the sample of respondents.  Information was collected on the facility background; vaccine logistic systems; child health services; antenatal and postpartum care; newborn and delivery care; sexually transmitted infection (STI) and voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services; and select medications.  The objective of this report is to present a set of indicators that are used by COMPASS and USAID for monitoring and evaluating program performance. Data from this end-of-project survey will be used to measure changes in health service indicators in the LGAs served by the COMPASS Project. Further, the results of the end-of-project survey may be used to redirect efforts or increase levels of intervention in selected areas based on the needs and goals of the health facilities in COMPASS project areas. Chapter 1 presents an overview of healthcare facilities. Chapter 2 describes facility characteristics, including service provision, facility amenities, outreac
h programs and infection prevention procedures. Chapter 3 provides information on family planning (FP) services, and chapter 4, on antenatal and postpartum care.  Chapter 5 presents findings related to child health and vaccination services. Chapter 6 describes STI and VCT services; while chapter 7 presents a comparison of the 2005 baseline survey and the 2009 endline survey to assess the degree of change in selected health indicators.

Such laws have reduced both the number of measures that make the ballot and the number that pass on Election Day. I show that laws governing access of initiatives to the ballot also shape the policy agenda; provisions making it harder for proposals to get on the ballot decrease the complexity of the initiatives on the ballot. As less complex initiatives are more likely to be understood by voters and voters are reluctant to vote for measures they do not understand, more restrictive laws actually increase the likelihood that an initiative will pass.",2015

We elucidate this puzzle with the first-ever systematic comparison of the entire careers of state legislative switchers and non-switchers in the American South, where the high prevalence of party switching coincided with rapid realignment toward the Republican Party. Our analysis is the first to evaluate all post-switch career decisions (retiring, running for reelection, running for higher office) simultaneously, and it is the broadest in its scope with two full decades of career data. We demonstrate that converts to the Grand Old Party (GOP) pay a reelection cost. However, they are less likely to retire than Democratic non-switchers and more likely to seek higher office. This latter finding is especially strong during the earlier part of our study – when the Republican bench in the South was not as deep and competition for the party label was not as intense. Our findings suggest that political ambition motivates legislators to trade short-term electoral costs for a more promising long-term electoral career with the ascendant party.",2018-12-9

The effect of the project was assessed in a “before-after and intervention-comparison” comparative framework. The baseline and endline data were compared between six randomly selected intervention districts and three comparison districts. The data on LA/PM use were collected from 5,800 randomly selected m
arried women of reproductive age during January-March 2013 both from the intervention and comparison districts. These data were compared with those obtained through the 2010 Bangladesh Maternal Mortality Survey, which was conducted during January-August 2010 in the six intervention and three comparison districts.  Additionally, data on provider skills and practices were collected from 720 government family planning workers from the six intervention districts and three comparison districts. The findings provide policy guidance for the promotion of LA/PM in Bangladesh.",

The Add Health cohort has been followed into young adulthood with four in-home interviews, the most recent in 2008, when the sample was aged 24-32*. Add Health combines longitudinal survey data on respondents’ social, economic, psychological and physical well-being with contextual data on the family, neighborhood, community, school, friendships, peer groups, and romantic relationships, providing unique opportunities to study how social environments and behaviors in adolescence are linked to health and achievement outcomes in young adulthood. The fourth wave of interviews expanded the collection of biological data in Add Health to understand the social, behavioral, and biological linkages in health trajectories as the Add Health cohort ages through adulthood.
<br/><br/> <b>Wave II</b> <br/> The public use dataset for Wave II contains information collected in 1996 from Add Health’s nationally representative sample of adolescents. Of the 6,504 Wave I public use respondents, 4,834 were interviewed at Wave II. The Wave II in-home interview was generally similar to that at Wave I. Questions about sun exposure and more detailed nutrition questions were added. Questions about attributes that should not change, such as ethnic background, were not repeated. P
hysical and functional limitations questions were omitted because the disabled sample was not re-interviewed. Respondents reported their height and weight during the course of the interview and were actually weighed and measured by the interviewer.

The study employed a mixed-methods approach, with a quasi-experimental quantitative evaluation design complemented by qualitative descriptive work to inform the findings. Data collection included surveys of medical facilities, patient chart abstraction, and provider, patient, and project staff in-depth interviews. TB diagnosis and treatment data were abstracted from medical records for five cohorts of TB patients to provide data on patients at high risk for defaulting on TB treatment, including those who did and did not receive any social support, patients at low risk for defaulting, and patients seen during 2014 and 2015. Data on risk distribution in the population of TB patients were abstracted from charts of patients seen in TB facilities during 2014 and 2014. Datasets include data from patient’s chart abstraction, health facility and Ukrainian Red Cross Society regional offices surveys. Phase 2 data were collected in 2016.

The main objective of the survey is to obtain national estimates of a number of key
indicators (including international standardized indicators) important to monitoring progress of the national HIV/AIDS/STDs programme.The survey provides indicators on HIV/AIDS/STI-related knowledge, attitudes, and sexual behaviour, as well as information on orphans and vulnerable children, and assistance to households and communities affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The 2009 survey provides national estimates that can be disaggregated by residence (rural/urban), age groups (adolescents, youths, young adults and adults), and by sex (males, females).

This paper explores this “pseudo-paradox”, and argues that the answer can be found in partisan redistricting.  Through an analysis of forty years of congressional elections, we find that partisan gerrymanders induce greater competitiveness as national tides increases, largely due to unanticipated consequences of waves adverse to the map-drawing party, particularly in seats held by that party.  The phenomenon anecdotally coined by Grofman and Brunell as the “dummymander” is thus actually quite common and has significant effects on rates of congressional competition nationally.  In contrast, bipartisan maps are shown to induce lower competition, while nonpartisan maps induce higher competition, under all electoral conditions and competitiveness measures.  But the effects of partisan gerrymanders on competition, while strong, can only be seen in interaction with short-term national forces.",2016

<b>Rationale</b> Early onset of alcohol drinking has been associated
with alcohol abuse in adulthood. The neurobiology of this
phenomenon is unclear, but mesolimbic dopamine pathways,
which are dynamic during adolescence, may play a role.<br>
<b>Objectives</b> We investigated the impact of adolescent bingelike
alcohol on phasic dopaminergic neurotransmission during
adulthood.<br>
<b>Methods</b>
Rats received intermittent intragastric ethanol, water,
or nothing during adolescence. In adulthood, electrically
evoked dopamine release and subsequent uptake were measured
in the nucleus accumbens core at baseline and after
acute challenge of ethanol or saline.<br>
<b>Results</b>
Adolescent ethanol exposure did not alter basal measures
of evoked dopamine release or uptake. Ethanol challenge
dose-dependently decreased the amplitude of evoked
dopamine release in rats by 30–50 % in control groups, as
previously reported, but did not alter evoked release in
ethanol-exposed animals. To address the mechanismby which
ethanol altered dopamine signaling, the evoked signals were
modeled to estimate dopamine efflux per impulse and the
velocity of the dopamine transporter. Dopamine uptake was
slower in all exposure groups after ethanol challenge
compared to saline, while dopamine efflux per pulse of electrical
stimulation was reduced by ethanol only in ethanolnaive
rats.<br>
<b>Conclusions</b> The results demonstrate that exposure to binge
levels of ethanol during adolescence blunts the effect of ethanol
challenge to reduce the amplitude of phasic dopamine
release in adulthood. Large dopamine transients may result
in more extracellular dopamine after alcohol challenge in
adolescent-exposed rats and may be one mechanism by which
alcohol is more reinforcing in people who initiated drinking at
an early age.

 The 2017 Emission Modeling Platform is primarily based on the 2017gb emissions case prepared by EPA, but there are differences between this package and the EPA emissions case:
- This package includes a newer airports inventory from 2017 NEI than was used in the 
  original 2017gb emissions case. This newer version, which was not available until after the 2017gb emissions case was completed in May 2020, corrects an overestimation of emissions from airports.
- This package includes average speed distributions (SPDIST) from 2017. The original 2017gb emissions case used average speed distributions from 2016. This is an input to SMOKE-MOVES and affects the ""RPD"" category of onroad emissions.

The states are useful to our understanding of labor's influence on inequality as states differ in their acceptance of labor unions, base levels of inequality, political preferences, industries, and levels of development, but are all nested within a single overarching national framework. Over the 39 year period examined, states where unions maintain more members remain more equal within the labor market and after redistribution via government transfer. These effects persist after accounting for state level policy, demography, and economic conditions. However, states where union membership has the largest influence on inequality have also seen growing attempts to reduce unionization rates.

Using a widely-distributed anesthesia calculator app as a platform, we were interested in assessing worldwide regional restrictions on the use of sugammadex, which is a drug used for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade. We were sought to obtain a crowdsourced measure of adverse event incidence associated with sugammadex administration and compare it to traditionally-derived estimates.  Using Anesthesiologist, an anesthesiology reference and calculator mobile application (app), we surveyed anesthesia providers in 187 countries regarding restrictions on sugammadex availability, barriers to sugammadex usage, and experience with adverse events. Cost restrictions were analyzed by region and country income level. A low and high-end incidence of adverse events was estimated based on respondents’ frequency and duration of sugammadex use.  Cost concerns were common while concerns about adverse events were rare. Regional and income-related variability in restrictions due to cost was observed. Providers in high-income countries were more likely to have access to sugammadex (p = 0.01) and to report cost-restrictions on sugammadex use (p = 0.002). The estimated incidence of anaphylaxis due to sugammadex was 1:1,000-1:20,000. Use of an in-app survey facilitated a global survey of anesthesia providers and could have useful applications in monitoring adverse events and trends in medication usage.We conclude that there is significant variability in the rate at which cost concerns drive provider behavior worldwide. These may arise from differences in health care systems and in the relative drug costs for sugammadex versus alternative reversal agents. ",2017-05-10

25368,https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/12165,,"Foundational studies in political science endeavored to explain the dynamics of voter turnout in America over time. Two theories, one focused on legal-institutional factors and the other on behavioral elements such as party mobilization strategies, were born from the need to account for temporal fluctuations in aggregate voter turnout. A comprehensive test of these competing theories has been hindered by the fact that reliable measures of the behavioral factors driving turnout have proven elusive. In this paper I develop and test an interactive theory of voter turnout that focuses on the impact of legal-institutional barriers to the franchise conditional on party organizational strength and mobilization efforts. To this end I employ data on the circulation of party-sponsored newspapers, coupled with information on the spread of voter registration requirements, to capture the effects of both behavioral and legal-institutional factors in Pennsylvania between 1876 and 1948. My results offer modest empirical support for an interactive theory of aggregate voter turnout. In isolation, however, the effects of behavioral factors are quite limited. On the other hand, legal-institutional variables exert a sizeable impact on voter turnout in the state. Contrary to other recent work on the subject, careful analysis of the Pennsylvania case therefore provides a great deal of evidence in favor of legal-institutional accounts of the changes in aggregate voter turnout that were witnessed at the beginning of the 20th century, while at the same time demonstrating that behavioral factors, such as the decline of the partisan press, served to enhance the del

30824,https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/7JU1AQ,,"The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) is the general civilian population aged 12 and older in the United States. Questions include age at first use, as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drugs: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine (including crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, tobacco, pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, perceptions of risks, and needle-sharing. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, educational level, job status, income level, veteran status, household composition, and population density.

The questionnaire was significantly redesigned in 1994. The 1994 survey for the first time included a rural population supplement to allow separate estimates to be calculated for this population. Other modules have been added each year and retained in subsequent years: mental health and access to care (1994-B); risk/availability of drugs (1996); cigar smoking and new questions on marijuana and cocaine use (1997); question series asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17 (1997); questions on tobacco brand (1999); marijuana purchase questions (2001); prior marijuana and cigarette use, additional questions on drug treatment, adult mental health services, and social environment (2003); and adult and adolescent depression questions derived from the National Comorbidity Survey, Replication (NCS-R) and National Comorbidity Survey, Adolescent (NCS-A) (2004).

Survey administration and sample design were improved with the implementation of the 1999 survey, and additional improvements were made in 2002. Since 1999, the survey sample has employed a 50-state design with an independent, multistage area probability sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. At this time, the collection mode of the survey changed from personal interviews and self-enumerated answer sheets to using computer-assisted personal interviews and audio computer-assisted self interviews. In 2002, the survey's title was officially changed to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Participants have been given $30 for participating in the study since then. This has resulted in an increase in participation rates from the years prior to 2002. Also, since 2002 the new population data from the 2000 decennial census has been used for sample weighting procedures. For these reasons, data gathered for 2002 and beyond cannot validly be compared to data prior to 2002.

A community-based cross sectional cluster survey was organized in the Garoua Boulai health district (East Region, Cameroon) where no ivermectin mass administration was ever performed. The prevalence of loiasis was 8.0% (95% CI: 7.2 – 9.0) and was quite different from one cluster to another (Minimum: 0.0%; Maximum: 43.5%). Onchocerciasis was found to be hypo-endemic (rate of exposure: 4.9%; 95% CI: 4.2 – 5.7), and the endemicity of LF was quite low (prevalence: 0.4%; 95% CI: 0.2 – 0.7).

professionalized legislatures are less likely to misestimate constituent
opinion. We investigate why this professionalism advantage exists. We
use a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to determine how much of the
professionalism advantage can be attributed to three sources: attracting
knowledgeable candidates, fostering legislator knowledge in office, and
retaining incumbents. We apply the decomposition to data on candidates’
perceptions of public opinion from the 2014 National Candidate Survey.

However, the question of how individual state supreme court judges respond to this third party information and whether or not judicial responses are conditioned by differing methods of judicial retention is rarely theorized.  Using social psychological theories of confirmation bias and motivated reasoning, this paper investigates how ideological predispositions and electoral institutions structure the responsiveness of state high court judges to amicus brief information.  Utilizing an original dataset of more than 14,000 votes of state high court judges across three distinct areas of law, this paper tests competing theories of amicus influence to determine how state high court judges utilize amicus information to render judicial decisions.  Results are generally supportive of the informational theory of amicus influence in complex areas of law.  However, a conditioning relationship of retention method suggests that competitive elections may alter the mechanism of amicus brief influence such that judicial responsiveness to third party briefs is more closely tied to the reelection and campaign fundraising considerations of individual judges in politically contentious areas of law.",2016-12-22

ual Behavior Survey (ZSBS) collected information on key indicators of HIV/AIDS/STD-related indicators of knowledge, attitude, and sexual behavior. The population-based survey consisted of a national sample of 1943 households, 97% of which responded. Individual response rates among eligible men and women were 92% and 96%, respectively. This 95-page report summarizes the ZSBS findings. Some key findings: virtually all respondents had heard of AIDS, and 86%
of men and 78% of women thought that HIV infection could be avoided. Two-thirds of men and 57% of women agreed that condom use was an effective prevention method. Only 7% of respondents thought it was acceptable for a married man to have extra-marital sexual relations, but 19% of men and 29% of women thought a man could not be sexually satisfied with just one partner. One in five adults were estimated to be HIV positive by 1995; however, few people knew their HIV status, and many held negative attitudes about HIV-positive people. Sexual behavior in Zambia had not changed drastically from 1996 to 1998, though unmarried men did report fewer partners. Close to one-thid of men reported using condoms in non-marital relationships, a slight decrease from 1996.

Determinants of health considered in the chartbook include demographic factors, healt

Many measures are shown separately for persons of different ages because of the strong effect of age on health, as well as differences in causes of morbidity and mortality across the age span. Selected figures also highlight differences in determinants and measures of health status by such characteristics as sex, race, and Hispanic origin. The chartbook section is followed by 147 trend tables organized around four major subject areas: health status and determinants, health care utilization, health care resources, and health care expenditures. A major criterion used in selecting the trend tables is availability of comparable national data over a period of several years. The tables report data for selected years to highlight major trends in health statistics. Many tables present data according to race and Hispanic origin.

Be- cause states compete for business investment and union (dis)organization likely has spillover effects beyond state borders, weak unions in one state may affect union or- ganization in other states. We examine how union decline in one state is associated with union decline in neighboring states, and whether the presence of pro-union (left-leaning) governments may limit the spread of union decline. Examining a pe- riod of major union decline (1983-2014), we find that union weakness in one state is associated with union weakness in nearby states. We observe that Democratic power in Congress is associated with higher unionization rates, but that liberal state governments have been relatively powerless to stop union decline in this pe- riod. These findings have important implications for understanding the historical and contemporary weakness of American unions and for the future of union strength in the U.S.",2019-01-29

Under this new system, all candidates regardless of party affiliation run against each other, narrowing the field down to the top two for the general election. In some jurisdictions, the general election features two candidates from the same party. Ten percent of California voters chose not to vote in the 2016 U.S. Senate election which featured two Democrats. Using data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (2012-2016), I find that among those who vote in the national November elections, orphans, or voters without a copartisan candidate on the ballot are more likely to undervote, opting out of voting in their congressional race. Levels of undervoting are nearly 20 percentage points more for orphaned voters compared to non-orphaned voters. Additionally, voters who abstain perceive more ideological distance between themselves and the candidates compared to voters who cast a vote. These findings support a multi-step framework for vote decisions in same-party matchups: voters are more likely to undervote if they are unable to vote for a candidate from their party (partisan model), but all voters are more likely to vote for a candidate when they perceive more ideological proximity (ideological model).",2019-07-17

The barangays, which contained about 28,000 households, were completely surveyed in late 1982 and again in early 1983 to locate all pregnant women. Women of the selected barangays who gave birth between May 1, 1983, and April 30, 1984, are included in the sample.

BACKGROUND
Tobacco, alcohol, and sugar consumption contribute to cancer burden. An evidence-based population-level intervention to reduce intake of tobacco, alcohol, and sugar-added products is the implementation of policies that increase their price. This can be done through excise taxes, mitigation fees, bans on discounts, and minimum prices. Yet, the adoption of these evidence-based policies has received only limited traction, and public support is undermined by industry-led efforts to oppose policy interventions. This proposal is guided by a working hypothesis that public acceptance of different tax and non-tax pricing interventions for cancer risk behaviors varies by: (a) policy type, (b) the way the message is framed, and (c) the cancer-causing product it addresses.
<p>
AIMS
We examine this working hypothesis through specific aims to: (1) identify and optimize ways to communicate price policy options for cancer-causing products to the public and (2) explore the effects of policy type, frames, and behavioural domain on public policy support.
<p>
PARTICIPANTS
Participants in the interview stage (qualitative) will be: 6 members of the public, 6 cancer survivors, and 6 cancer policy advocates – half of each stakeholder group will be in each country. Participants in the quantitative study will be solicited by Qualtrics's Survey Panels service (n=1800).
<p>
METHODS
This project will use a mixed-methods approach to understand the framing of tax and non- tax pricing policy interventions to reduce consumption of cancer-causing products. We will conduct formative qualitative research with stakeholders, identify frames to test, and pilot the frames in a quantitative study. We will then implement a 3x3x4 factorial experiment to assess the impact of the frames, cancer-causing products discussed, and pricing policy options on support for policies among UK and US adults.",2019-04-12

They provide essential information for government, business, industry, and the general public. Economic censuses furnish an important part of the framework for such composite measures as the gross national product, input-output measures, production and price indexes, and other statistical series that measure short-term changes in economic conditions. Policy-making agencies of the F

State and local Governments use the data to assess business activities and tax bases within their jurisdictions and to develop programs to attract business. Trade associations study trends in their own and competing industries, and keep their members informed of market changes. Individual businesses use the data to locate potential markets and to analyze their own production and sales performance relative to industry or area averages. Title 13 of the United States Code (sections 131, 191, and 224) directs the Census Bureau to take the economic censuses every 5 years, covering years ending in 2 and 7. The 1987 Economic Censuses consist of the: Census of Retail Trade, Census of Wholesale Trade, Census of Service Industries Census of Transportation, Census of Manufactures, Census of Mineral Industries, and the Census of Construction Industries.

Traditionally, safety and injury analysis has occurred in siloed fields, with road safety researchers relying predominately on police-recorded crash reports, and public health researchers relying on hospitalization records. Depending on the context of the study and the database used, findings vary. This is the case for the micro-level (e.g., injury severity of an individual) to the macro-level (e.g., injury rate) scale.

This project begins to map disparate data sets to inform questions surrounding crashes. The data-mapping process will aim to build linkages between police-crash datasets and other datasets (i.e., incident-oriented data, spatial data, emerging datasets) and scale it up to larger geographic areas. Efforts to augment crash data are not new. A notable health-oriented example which sought to link health and police records was the Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System (CODES). Although this federal program ended in 2013, some states, including California, North Carolina, and Tennessee, have continued this effort.

Added data and analytics resulted in a more “complete picture” of crashes and injuries. This complete picture enables researchers to improve their modeling, assist policy makers, and contribute to visualization that helps tell compelling safety stories that guide safety improvements.

What factors are associated with WQT existence, prevalence, and operational stage? In this paper, we present and analyze the most complete database of WQT programs in the United States (147 programs/policies), detailing market designs, trading mechanisms, traded pollutants, and segmented geographies in 355 distinct markets. We use hurdle models (joint binary and count regressions) to evaluate markets in concert with demographic, political, and environmental covariates. We find that only one half of markets become operational, new market establishment has declined since 2013, and market existence and prevalence has nuanced relationships with local political ideology, urban infrastructure, waterway and waterbody extents, regulated environmental impacts, and historic waterway impairment. Our findings suggest opportunities for better projecting program need and targeting program funding.",

31106,https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/ARI4FZ,,"We conducted an Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI; or experience sampling) study to examine the effect of positive psychology and contemplative practices on the within-person processes in experienced love in daily life and how these processes relate to person characteristics. This study was conducted at the Pennsylvania State University. The study procedure along with the sample characteristics is as follows:
<br>
<br>
SAMPLE. In this EMI study, the sample consisted of 160 undergraduate students (51 male and 109 female, mean age = 20.31 years, SD = 1.23, min = 18, max = 22), recruited at Pennsylvania State University.
<br>
<br>
PROCEDURE. This was an eight-week long EMI study examining the effects of positive psychology and contemplative mobile interventions on feelings of love and well-being. The EMIs used in this study consisted of three positive psychology practices (Act of Kindness, Gratitude, Best Possible Self) and contemplative practices (a three-minute meditation session and a reminder throughout the day about the intention of the day). 
<br>
<br>
The study included two experimental groups and one control group (detailed below). Across the study, there was one introductory session, three intermediate sessions, and one final session for all participants in which they completed a battery of surveys (BFI-2, Health, Gratitude, Flourishing, PERMA profiler, Mindfulness, Self-Compassion, Interpersonal Support Evaluation, Attachment, Emotion Regulation). In addition, during all 56 days participants received and responded to up to 336 text-message prompted web-based EMA surveys (six per day). Each EMA survey included an item on momentary feelings of love (“How much do you feel loved right now?”) in addition to items on satisfaction with relationships and feeling supported by others. Other EMA items were related to their momentary well-being, sleep, and stress. Each EMA survey contained 10-12 statements in which participants used a sliding scale to respond (from Not at all to Extremely). Survey timing was determined by dividing participants' self-reported usual waking hours into six equal-length intervals, and survey prompts were delivered at a random timing within each time interval, constrained so that no two prompts were less than 30 minutes apart.  
<br>
<br>
The study is divided into ten parts:<br>
- Introductory session (60 minutes per person). The participants completed a battery of self-report surveys (mentioned above) and demographics. They then provided informed consent and their respective phone numbers were registered with the text messaging service SurveySignal (SurveySignal, LLC, 2015).<br>
-14-day pre-intervention period. Participants completed the EMA online survey six times, randomly throughout the day. This  period is a replication of our previous EMA study (Within-person processes in experienced love in daily life, 2016). <br>
-Intermediate interview 1 (30 minutes per person). In this session, participants first complete a battery of tests that is a subset of the ones that were administered during introductory session (estimated time 10-15 minutes). Then, instructions about the next phase of the study (15-day intervention study period) are explained to them. <br>
-15-day intervention period. in addition to the EMA surveys administered 6 times a day, depending on the group that the participants are assigned, they received additional activities:<br>
•	Positive Psychology Intervention (PPI) Group: At the end of each day, an hour before participants’ sleep time, an additional text message was sent to participants with instructions about a PPI (Random Act of Kindness, or Gratitude, or Best Possible Self) that they enacted and reported on. <br>
•	Contemplative & PP Intervention Group: Similar to the previous group, this group was given instructions for enacting one of the three PPI activities every night. Additionally, each morning this group received instructions for a three-minute meditation session and throughout the day along with the 6 EMA surveys, participants were reminded about the intention of the day (depending on the PPI assigned for that day).<br>
•	Active Control Group: This group simply received the same EMA signals 6 times a day. To keep the participants engaged in the study and match the activities in the intervention groups, we asked them to complete a working memory task sent to them via text messages at the end of each night.<br>
-Intermediate interview 2 (30 minutes per person). Participants completed a battery of tests that were a subset of the ones that were administered during introductory session.<br>
-13-day post-intervention period 1. Participants repeated taking the EMA 6 times daily for the next 13 days.<br>
-Intermediate interview 3 (30 minutes per person). Participants completed a battery of tests that is a subset of the ones that were administered during introductory session.
-14-day post-intervention period 2. Participants repeated taking the EMA 6 times daily for the next 14 days.<br>
-Final interview (30 minutes per person). Participants once more completed the same battery of tests completed in previous interviews and were also briefed about their experience in the study.<br>
-Follow-up online survey 30 days after end of study (15 minutes). 30 days after the completion of the study, a follow up online survey was sent to the participants who consented to receive and complete this survey. This survey included the same battery of tests administered in all previous interviews.

3552,https://hdl.handle.net/1902.29/CAPS-TSC,,"<p>The Tennessee Self Concept Scale (TSCS) is a 120 item true-false questionnaire designed to assess self esteem in adults. Developed by Fitts (1965), the scale assesses seven different dimensions of self esteem as well as a subtle measure of self criticism derived from test-taking response style. The seven areas of self esteem are: Identity, Behavior, Self-satisfaction, Physical self, Moral-ethical self, Personal self, Family self, and Social self. A Total Self Esteem Score can also be computed
from all the scales. The primary advantage that the TSCS offers over other available self esteem measures is its assessment of a number of different dimensions of the self, including for the present study Social Self and Family Self. The Self criticism scale is also a nicely subtle index of the respondent's tendency to select negative statements to negate positive ones about the self. Research with the TSCS shows that low self esteem is correlated with depression and other types of psychological problems (Fitts, 1965).
</p><p>The 10 scales provided on the CAPS datafile are described below: SELFCRIT The Self Criticism Score: This scale is composed of 10 items. These are all mildly derogatory statements that most people admit as being true for them. Individuals who deny most of these statements are being defensive and making a deliberate effort to present a favorable picture of themselves. High scores generally indicate a normal, healthy openness and capacity for self-criticism, although scores above the 99th pe
rcentile may indicate pathology. Low scores indicate defensiveness and suggest that total positive scores are probably artificially elevated by this defensiveness.
</p><p>TOTPOS The Total Positive Score: This is seen as the most important score from the TSC. It reflects overall level of self esteem. Persons with high scores like themselves, feel they have value and worth, have confidence in themselves, and act accordingly. People with low scores are doubtful about their own worth and feel anxious, depressed and unhappy.</p><p>IDENTITY The Identity Score: These are 'what I am' items. Here the person is describing his/her basic identity.</p><p>SELFSATI The S
elf Satisfaction Score: On these items, the person describes how he/she feels about the self he/she perceives. This score reflects the level of self satisfaction or self acceptance.
</p><p>BEHAVIOR The Behavior Score: This score measures the individual's perception of his own behavior or the way he functions.</p><p>PHYSSELF The Physical Self Score: This is the individual's view of his body, his state of health, his physical appearance, skills, and sexuality.</p><p>MORLSELF The Moral Ethical Self Score: This describes the self from a moral-ethical frame of reference -- moral worth, relationship to God, feelings of being a 'good' or 'bad' person.</p><p>PERSSELF The Personal S
elf Score: This reflects the individual's sense of personal worth, feeling of adequacy as a person and evaluation of his personality apart from his body or relationships with others.
</p><p>FAMISELF The Family Self Score: This reflects the respondent's feelings of adequacy, worth, and value as a family member. It refers to the individual's perception of self in reference to his closest and most immediate circle of associates.</p><p>SOCISELF The Social Self Score: This is another self as perceived in relation to others category, but pertains to others in a more general way. It reflects the person's sense of adequacy and worth in his social interaction with others in general.<

Committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5, Bangladesh’s targets are to reduce the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to 143 per 100,000 live births by 2015, and to increase skilled attendance at birth to 50 percent by 2016. In the last decade, the health, nutrition, and population sector program of Bangladesh has adopted a national strategy for maternal h

methodological techniques for harmonizing measures for substance use and related
disorders across a broad range of measurement contexts and (2) to evaluate a series of hypotheses concerning the social and environmental factors that lead young-adult
college students towards or away from substance use behavior.  However, in accomplishing these objectives, we also included measures that have to do with friendships (history and quality) and well-being (the Ryff scales) as well as social  media use, gratitude, and health behaviors (sleep, substance use, depression).  The Ryff scales also consider: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relationships with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance.  The relationship quality scale (the NRI) assess friendship quality in terms of affection (liking and loving), companionship, conflict, instrumental aid, antagonism, intimate disclosure, nurturance, and reassurance of worth.  
<br> <br>
Sample: The study sample was comprised of 923 pairs college student friend dyads (total =1846) from a single university. Inclusion criteria for target participants were being between 18-26 years of age, currently enrolled as a university student, and reports of any alcohol use in the past year at the point of screening. Inclusion criteria for peer participants included being over age 18 and never having participated in the study before. Male and ethnic minority students were oversampled. Students were recruited through two sources. First, we sent invitations to 8,199 undergraduate students whose contact information we obtained through the registrar’s office or who participated in the a previous study. Second, we had an additional 116 individuals contact us asking to participate in the study after hearing about it from a friend. Out of the 1,468 who completed our pre-screen from either source, 1,270 were eligible to participate; ineligibility was due to age (1), non-student status (1) no alcohol use in the past year (17) and  previous involvement in the study (3).  Of those eligible, 949 scheduled sessions for the study. A total of 923 students completed the first session and 901 dyads (or 922 targets and 902 peers) completed both visits.  
<br> <br>
This study is a companion to the REAL-U study, that used a similar battery with college students but did not use a paired friendship design.  (But could provide replication data and for a smaller subsample longitudinal follow-up data).  Together the two studies include 2,600 participates, with 1584 European American, 660 Black/African Americans, 240 Asian/Asian Americans, and 266 Latinx students.
<br> <br>
Procedures. For the MFS study, selected students were first sent a personalized email containing a brief description of the study, a link to the study’s website, and a link to a Qualtrics-based prescreen survey.  The prescreen evaluated the target’s eligibility and, for qualifying individuals, allowed them to nominate up to four friends to participant in the study with them as their peer. The first-choice friend, (the status of whom was designated by the order in which the target nominated their friends), automatically received a pre-screen survey of their own, which evaluated their eligibility. If the peer was determined to be eligible, their completed survey triggered an automatic email from Qualtrics that provided both the target and the peer with sign up instructions for the study’s research portal.  The pair was instructed to sign up for two testing sessions, exactly two weeks apart that they were both available to attend together. At the first testing session, participants completed consent procedures and a computerized battery of surveys. 
<br> <br>
Participants were randomly assigned to one of five conditions, which determined the batteries to be completed at session one and session two. There were four batteries: Battery A and Battery B which were designed for target participants and Battery C and Battery D, designed for their peer counterpart. In the first condition, target participants would complete Battery A both sessions, and their peer would complete Battery C at both sessions. In the second condition, targets would complete Battery B at both sessions and their peers would complete Battery D at both sessions. In the third condition, the target would complete Battery A at visit one, then Battery B at visit two, and their peers would complete Battery C at visit one, then Battery D at visit two. In the fourth condition, targets would complete Battery A at both sessions while their peers would complete Battery D at both sessions. In condition five, target participants would complete Battery B at visit one, then Battery A at visit two, while their peers would complete Battery C at visit one and Battery D at visit two. In general, target batteries (A and B) primarily consisted of questions about the target participant him- or herself while the peer batteries (C and D) asked questions about the peers as well as about the target friend who participated with them. Procedures for sessions one and two took approximately 60 minutes to complete. At the end of the second testing session, participants were invited to participate in a second consent procedure permitting the study team to access their student adjudication data as protected by FERPA.  Participants received a $20 incentive for completion of the first testing session and a $25 incentive for completing the second testing session (regardless of whether they provided consent for their adjudication data). If participants consented to waiving their FERPA rights, they were entered into one of four lottery drawings for $100 each.
<br> <br>
Procedures for harmonizing and parsing data are the primary focus of the data design but can be leveraged for a variety of questions.

The survey extracted a Sportsman sample (fishing and hunting) and conducted the first detailed interview. If any of the household members had participated in wild

The second wave of interviewing was conducted in September and October, 1996. For this wave, the study selected household members who had not participated by the Wave 1 date of interview but were likely to participate during 1996. Their likelihood of participation was determined by their past participation levels and their stated likeliness to participate in 1996. This was the first detailed interview for these respondents. It was possible for a respondent who was in the Sportsman sample in Wave 1 to be selected for the Wildlife Watching sample in Wave 2 or for a Wildlife Watching respondent in Wave 1 to be selected for the Sportsman sample for Wave 2. Wave 3 began in January 1997 and continued into the first part of March 1997. The wave 3 sample consisted of respondents from both Wave 1 and Wave 2.

In this research, the purpose was to analyze, how people who use social media actively perceive the connection between social media and romantic relationships. The research questions set for this study were: (1) What are the rules of self-disclosure that support romantic relationships in social media?; (2) What kinds of benefits do social media provide for romantic relationships?; and (3) What kinds of threats or disadvantages do social media provide for romantic relationships? This was a qualitative research in which the research participants (N=25) were approached with an online questionnaire that included open-ended questions. The answers were analyzed with the qualitative content analyzing method. The findings showed that the research participants could name some principles of self-disclosure regarding their romantic relationships in social media and certain benefits as well as harms and threats of social media for a romantic relationship. The findings were further discussed in the light of the elements of love as emotions, love as actions, and love as skills and knowledge that here could be interpreted as “the media literacy of romantic relationships”.

Researchers interviewed 2,100 individuals at more than 250 of these sites about their risk behaviors, receptivity to HIV/AIDS prevention efforts.

Traditionally, safety and injury analysis has occurred in siloed fields, with road safety researchers relying predominately on police-recorded crash reports, and public health researchers relying on hospitalization records. Depending on the context of the study and the database used, findings vary. This is the case for the micro-level (e.g., injury severity of an individual) to the macro-level (e.g., injury rate) scale.

This project begins to map disparate data sets to inform questions surrounding crashes. The data-mapping process will aim to build linkages between police-crash datasets and other datasets (i.e., incident-oriented data, spatial data, emerging datasets) and scale it up to larger geographic areas. Efforts to augment crash data are not new. A notable health-oriented example which sought to link health and police records was the Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System (CODES). Although this federal program ended in 2013, some states, including California, North Carolina, and Tennessee, have continued this effort.

Added data and analytics resulted in a more “complete picture” of crashes and injuries. This complete picture enables researchers to improve their modeling, assist policy makers, and contribute to visualization that helps tell compelling safety stories that guide safety improvements.

We study these effects in the context of annual nursing home inspections performed by state administrators and make two predictions. First, as Democratic legislators will, on average, prefer a more activist role for government and for government agencies, we should see agencies issue more citations for violations of regulations when state legislatures are Democratic and fewer when they are Republican. Second, as more professionalized legislatures are better able to monitor the agency inspectors’ actions and inspection outcomes, this effect should be intensified for legislatures with greater professionalism.

One of the determinants of this reaction is the degree to which the individual perceives that the reward follows from, or is contingent upon, his own behavior or attributes (internal control) versus the degree to which he feels the reward is controlled by forces outside of himself and may occur
independently of his own actions (external control).' Rotter's definition of the construct deals only with a person's perception of contingency relationships between his own behavior and events which follow that behavior. In its present form, the test consists of 23 question pairs, using a forced-choice format, plus 6 filler questions. Internal statements are paired with external statements. One point is given for each external statement selected. Scores can range from zero (most internal) to 23 (most external).

This group of items would appear to be reflecting and measuring the construct as it has been defined by Rotter. Although this factor tends to account for most of the scale variance, a second factor -- 'control ideology' (which could as easily be called 'control attribution'), in which the items are phrased in the third person -- appears with so

29252,https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/DANYSO,,"Most state supreme court justices have time-bound terms that require them to be reappointed or reelected after a certain amount of time.  In three American states, South Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia, the legislature has the sole power to retain justices.  Legislatures, and their specialized judiciary committees, are well positioned to monitor judicial behavior and can reject retention for justices who are unacceptable.  This turns the legislature’s oversight authority into influence over policymaking by justices who still need to be reappointed to additional terms.  But some justices (co-partisans) are insulated from this influence by their connections to the majority party, which substantially increases the likelihood of their retention.  I show that, between 1995-2014, justices appointed by the minority party who were eligible for a new term voted more in line with the preferences of their legislature than those who were no longer eligible for a new term due to mandatory or voluntary retirement.  No similar effect is found among appointees of the majority party.  To support my argument that it is the legislature’s reappointment authority that gives them this power, I conduct a placebo test to show that governors in these states enjoy no comparable influence on reappointment-seeking justices.  This legislative influence represents a substantial limitation on judicial independence.",

<p>*CMAQ represents PM using three interacting lognormal distributions, or modes. Two modes, Aitken (i-mode) and accumulation (j-mode) are generally less than 2.5 microns in diameter while the coarse mode (k-mode) contains significant amounts of mass above 2.5 microns.<br></p> 

<p>**Note that modeled size distributions can also be used to output PM species that represent the aerosol mass that falls below a specific diameter, e.g. 2.5 um or 10um. The output variables that are based on the sharp cut-off method are typically very similar to the aggregate PMIJ (i+j mode) and PM10 (i+j+k mode) variables included in these files.

Specifically, I explore the degree to which candidate characteristics, state political environments, and the attributes of state institutions affect the size of individual contributions.  The findings of this investigation indicate the participation of contributors in judicial elections closely resembles the activities of voters. Like voters, contributors respond to contextual forces that increase or decrease salience and the political information available to state citizens.  Of particular importance are state decisions to use partisan or nonpartisan election designs.  Decisions by states to use partisan elections have important consequences for the generosity of contributors with larger donations directed to candidates seeking office in the most professionalized elective state supreme courts.",

The purpose of the NHIS is to obtain information about the amount and distribution of illness, its effects in terms of disability and chronic impairments, and
the kinds of health services people receive. Information is obtained on the number of restricted-activity days, bed days, work- or school-loss days, and all physician visits occurring during the 2-week period prior to the week of the interview. Data are also obtained on the acute and chronic conditions that were responsible for these days or visits. Respondents are asked about long-term limitation of activity and the chronic conditions related to this disability. All conditions are coded according to the Health Interview Survey Medical Coding Manual and Short Index, a modified version of the International Classification of Diseases, using the limited diagnostic detail available from a household respondent. Data are obtained on all hospital episodes during the prior 12 months, including length of stay and whether surgery was performed. The data files are divided into two modules: the basic module and the topical module. Data files from the basic module are: Household, Family

Couples first completed a background survey that took about 30 minutes to complete.
Couples chose a day of the week that was particularly good for them to complete surveys on (e.g., Sundays). Each couple started the two-week diary study on the day they selected. They completed 15 daily diaries total. On days 1, 8, and 15, participants also completed a longer “weekly” survey. So for example, a couple who chose Sunday as their preferred day would complete the weekly survey on three Sundays in a row, with daily diaries completed every day. On weekly days, participants first completed the weekly survey followed by that day’s diary.

The vote-counting crisis in the presidential election in Florida in 2000 forced policymakers in all 50 states to re-examine their own election laws and procedures. Some state leaders acted as entrepreneurs, seizing the opportunity to advance major reform, while others sought only modest or no substantive change. We test the impact of political leadership on policy adoption in a crisis situation by constructing a leadership variable from content analysis of news coverage in the states. We find that the activities of elected or appointed policymakers, particularly the states' chief elections officials (CEOs), had a decisive effect on the extent of election reforms adopted by the states. Five other factors also affected the adoption of election reforms: political culture, the ideology of a state's electorate, recommendations by statewide commissions, legislative term limits, and the interaction between the winner's margin of victory in the 2000 presidential election and the state's residual vote rate.",

The data is provided to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program by the registration offices of all States, the District of Columbia, and New York City. Data from New York, excluding New York City, were submitte

Fetal death data are limited to deaths occurring within the United States to U.S. residents and nonresidents. Fetal deaths occurring to U.S. citizens outside the United States are not included in this data file. In NCHS tabulations by place of residence, fetal deaths to nonresidents of the United States are excluded. The foreign resident records can be identified by code 4 in tape location 7 of the data tape. In addition, the majority of fetal death tables published by NCHS include only those fetal deaths with stated or presumed gestation of 20 weeks or more (see the Technical Appendix). Those records identified with a 2 in tape location 5 are included in these tabulations. All other records are excluded. Effective January 1, 1989, a revised U-S. Standard Report of Fetal Death replaced the 1978 revision. The 1989 revision provides a wide variety of new information on maternal and fetal health characteristics. Questions on complications of labor and delivery and congenital anomalies of fetus were changed from an open-ended question to a checkbox format to improve reporting of information. Several new items were added that improve the data files value for monitoring and research of factors affecting fetal mortality. The Office of Management and Budget revised its designation of metropolitan statistical areas based on figures from the 1990 Census. Effective with the 1990 data file, NCHS has been using these new definitions and codes as indicated in the listing of 320 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAS), Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAS), and New England County Metropolitan Ar
eas (NEaSS) included in this documentation. There are also 20 Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (mSAS), which are made up of PMSAS. Geographic changes based on the 1990 Census have been implemented. NCHS has adopted a new policy on release of vital statistics unit record data files. This new policy was implemented with the 1989 vital event files to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of individuals and institutions. As a result, this file does not contain the actual day of the death. The geographic detail is also restricted-only counties and cities of 100,000 or more population based on the 1980 Census as well as metropolitan areas of 100,000 or more population based on the 1990 Census, are identified. Fetal deaths for Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and Guam are included as separate data sets.

The print version of this reference source has been published since 1878 while the compact disc version first appeared in 1993. This disc is designed to serve as a convenient, easy-to-use statistical reference source and guide to statistical publications and sources. The disc contains over 1,400 tables from over 250 different gove
rnmental, private, and international organizations. The 1997 Statistical Abstract on CD-ROM, like the book, is a statistical reference and guide to over 250 statistical publications and sources from government and private organizations. This compact disc (CD) has 1,500 tables and charts from over 250 sources. Text and tables can be viewed or searched with the software. Tables and charts cover these subjects in 31 sections and 2 appendices: Population, Vital Statistics, Health and Nutrition, Education, Law Enforcement, Courts and Prisons, Geography and Environment, Parks, Recreation and Travel, Elections, State and Local Government, Finances and Employment, Federal Government, Finances and Employment, National Defense and Veterans Affairs, Social Insurance and Human Services, Labor Force, Employment and Earnings, Income, Expenditure and Wealth, Prices, Banking, Finance and Insurance, Business Enterprise, Communications, Energy, Science, Transportation -- Land, Transportation -- Air and Water, Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries, Mining and Mineral Products, Construction and Housing, Manufactures, Domestic Trade and Services, Foreign Commerce and Aid, Outlying Areas, Comparative International Statistics, State Rankings, Population of MSAs, Congressional District Profiles. The 1997 CD includes major changes in both the content of the information on the disc and software used for accessing the information. As usual, updates have been made to most of the more than 1,400 tables that were on the previous disc with new or more recent data. The spreadsheet files for these tables usually have more information than displayed in the book or Adobe Acr
obat files. There are also 97 new tables on such subjects as mammography, overweight persons, schools with Internet access, college remedial work, hate crimes, weather disasters, pet ownership, employer tenure, work disabilities, workplace drug testing, family net worth, family debt payments, minority- owned businesses, traffic fatalities, supply and use of various foods, several new housing tables, and international statistics for continuing education and tourism receipts. See Appendix V on the disc for a complete list of the new tables presented. In the software area, Adobe Acrobat Reader and Search engine have been added to allow users to view, navigate, search, and print on demand any of the pages from the book. Data files are included in Excel (xls) and Lotus (.wk1) spreadsheets.

In contrast to an emerging consensus concluding that southern African Americans materially benefited from rejoining the electorate, this study suggests that higher black registration rates actually reduced states’ poverty relief efforts. In the immediate post-VRA years, when Democrats controlled state government, the significant negative relationship between the size of the black electorate and state welfare generosity was moderated to some extent by high levels of partisan competition. In such cases Democrats ostensibly chose a “core” targeting strategy of pursuing lower-income votes and had the institutional wherewithal to purchase these votes with policy concessions. Overall, however, the liberal “Downsian” policy response to African American mobilization was dominated by an anti-redistributive response. In the South, welfare policies were relatively conservative vis-à-vis the other states during Jim Crow and became even more so in response to black voting.",2016

These effects are measured by a variety of means: detailed monitoring of individuals' health status and dietary intake, precise measurement of household-level expenditures and service utilization, and collection of relevant community-level data, including
region-specific prices and community infrastructure data. Phase II data have been collected annually (with two exceptions) since 1994. The project has been run jointly by the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, headed by Barry M. Popkin, and the Demoscope team in Russia, headed by Polina Kozyreva and Mikhail Kosolapov.
</p>  <b>Please note</b> <p>The sample size in 2014 was cut by about 20%, because the cost of the project increased due to inflation, but financial support remained the same. The original 1994 sample remained the same, and all cuts applied only to the part of the sample which was added in 2010. It should be stated that the implemented procedure of cutting the sample size guarantees that the smaller sample is still representative at the national level. To lower the cost it was also decided to dro
p the Educational Expenses section from the HH questionnaire, which was added back in 2010.
</p>   <b>Household Data</b> <p>For the household interview, a single member of the household was asked questions that pertained to the entire family. The respondent was usually the oldest living woman in the home since she was available to be interviewed during the daytime. Any attempt to identify one person as the ""household head"" is as problematic in Russia as it is in the United States. Thus, the interviewer was instructed to speak with ""the person who knows the most about this family's shop
ping and health.""</p>  <b>Individual Data</b> <p>In theory, the individual questionnaire is administered to every person living in the household. In practice, however, some individuals, such as very young children and elderly people, did not receive an individual interview. Individual-level information is the primary source of information pertaining to a person's health, employment status, demographic characteristics, and anthropometry. It can also be used to supplement household-level income an
d expenditure information.</p>  <p>To safeguard the confidentiality of RLMS respondents, individual-level data sets omit text variables (designated char on questionnaires). Please note that almost all text variables exist in Russian only. English translations exist for only a few of these variables.

The aim was to measure both state (current or recent) and trait (chronic) loneliness, something that has rarely been done in loneliness studies. This was accomplished by using identical items in the state and trait scales, with the for
mer referring to 'the last few days' and the latter to 'the last few years'. Both scales have proven internally consistent (alpha approximately equal to .90) in previous studies (e.g., Shaver, Furman, and Buhrmester, 1985). The two scales are usually moderately correlated with each other, especially if the respondents are in a fairly familiar and stable social environment. On the trait measure, there are four additional items meant to assess self-attributions of loneliness.

31283,https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/OKCXPZ,,"This study examines how state government responses to economic crisis, in the form of unexpected changes in state fiscal policy, influence income inequality. State governments are vital actors in times of fiscal stress since nearly every state must make difficult policy decisions related taxes and spending to address budget deficits, both of which are policies that shape the income gap. Focusing on periods of fiscal stress is important for the study of state inequality since those with fewer resources are the most likely to experience the consequences of their state's fiscal response during these times. Using time-series cross-sectional data, this research demonstrates that income inequality increases when states respond to economic crisis by relying on unexpected spending cuts. These effects tend to persist even after initial economic downturns. Additionally, one individual-level implication of the aggregate relationship between state policy responses and inequality -- that people will be worse off financially when their states emphasize budget cuts in response to economic decline  -- is assessed using several post-Great Recession surveys. The findings have implications for the future of inequality in the U.S. and provide potential paths for state fiscal reform.",2020-02-10

The second area of need is in the field of ecological momentary assessment, also referred to as experience sampling: researchers in a wide variety of fields, spanning from the social sciences to psychology to clinical medicine, would like to be able to capture daily or even more frequent data from research subjects while in their natural environment. Survalytics is an open-source solution for the collection of survey responses as well as arbitrary analytic metadata from users of Android OS applications. Surveys may be administered in any combination of one-time questions and ongoing questions.

I argue that social capital enhances social empathy in homogenous contexts and social controls in diverse contexts. Using state-level longitudinal data on the contiguous states, I find that social capital is positively associated with incarcerations, but only for African Americans. Furthermore, the effects of social capital appear to be conditional on racial context where this relationship is stronger as minority group size increases.",2017-03-09

The project first convened a diverse group of cross-sector experts and examined available data sources to explore the underlying and complex factors influencing the national rise in pedestrian deaths. These efforts supported the development of dynamic, testable hypotheses to inform a future research agenda. This project was designed to also demonstrate an application of innovative systems science tools as a means for examining underlying drivers of complex problems and exploring effective leverage points for interventions. An initial set of systems mapping workshops with diverse stakeholders produced numerous theories involving about 40 key variables/themes related to the rise of pedestrian fatalities, many of which were further substantiated by additional data and literature scans. Additionally, hypotheses about system structures -- including balancing and reinforcing feedback loops -- thought to be accelerating or mitigating the fatality trends were uncovered.",2018-09-30

Specifically, we examine how threats of noncompliance and legislative override influence decisions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Based on a statistical analysis of a novel dataset of ECJ rulings, we find that the preferences of member-state governments—whose interests are central to threats of noncompliance and override—have a systematic and substantively important impact on ECJ decisions.",

Subsequent surveys took place immediately after birth, then at bimonthly intervals for 24 months. From the baseline sample, there were 3,080 nontwin live births. Approximately 2,600 households were studied intensively for the full 2 years. Each survey collects detailed health, nutrition, demographic, and socioeconomic data.

Using the synthetic control method I create a counterfactual Nebraska from a weighted-average of other potential control states and compare spending in this ""synthetic Nebraska"" to spending in the real Nebraska.  Relative to the synthetic control, Nebraska experiences a sharp decrease in expenditures per capita immediately following the switch to a unicameral legislature, however, the difference appears to diminish over time. Placebo tests show that if the change in Nebraska's legislative structure were randomly assigned among the sample of states, and legislative structure had no real impact on spending, the likelihood of obtaining a treatment effect estimate as large as Nebraska's would be 0.0213. While the initial drop in expenditures per capita lends support to the theory that bicameralism, by requiring more veto players, is associated with higher levels of government spending, the fact that the difference between Nebraska and synthetic Nebraska diminishes suggests that legislators are able to circumvent this constraint.",

The goal was to help build a knowledge base to inform future programs and policies to promote savings and accumulation of productive assets in sub-Saharan Africa. AssetsAfrica was conducted by researchers at the Global Social Development Innovations, in partnership with the Center for Social Development (CSD) at Washington University in St. Louis and Build Africa Uganda.
<br>
<br>
AssetsAfrica used a nonequivalent groups design with pre and posttest. The study used purposive sampling. Half of the sample households were assigned to the treatment condition and the other half to the comparison condition. Baseline data were collected in August 2005 and a follow-up survey was conducted in September 2006. Data on participants’ savings and withdrawal patterns were tracked and collated using an account monitoring software called MISIDA.
<br>
<br>
Participants in the treatment group received (1) training in financial management and asset building, and (2) individual bank accounts with the Masindi branch of Stanbic Bank. Participants were expected to save into their accounts for at least six months before they were eligible for a match of 1:1. A household could receive a maximum matched fund of $285. After they reached their savings target and were matched, participants bought their desired assets (e.g., livestock, means of transport, house, land for agricultural use, and tools/equipment for small business start-ups), with the guidance of Build Africa Uganda and CSD.

We test these hypotheses by analyzing votes for California's Proposition 209 in 1996, which aimed to end affirmative action in the state. Our census-tract-level analysis suggests that white support for Proposition 209 was higher in tracts with larger Latino, African-American, or Asian-American populations, even after controlling for other factors.

However, in situations involving federal or state level policy, development responds not just to one regulatory signal, but also to multiple signals from overlapping and competing jurisdictions. The 1982 U.S. Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CoBRA) offers an opportunity to study when and how development restrictions and economic disincentives protect natural resources by stopping or slowing urban development in management regimes with distributed authority and responsibility. CoBRA prohibits federal financial assistance for infrastructure, post-storm disaster relief, and flood insurance in designated sections (CoBRA units) of coastal barriers. How has CoBRA’s removal of these subsidies affected rates and types of urban development? Using building footprint and real estate data (n=1,385,552 parcels), we compare density of built structures, land use types, residential house size, and land values within and outside of CoBRA units in eight Southeast and Gulf Coast  states. We show that CoBRA is associated with reduced development rates in designated coastal barriers. We also demonstrate how local responses may counteract withdrawal of federal subsidies. As attention increases towards improving urban resilience in high hazard areas, this work contributes to understanding how limitations on infrastructure and insurance subsidies can affect outcomes where overlapping jurisdictions have competing goals.",

Add Health combines longitudinal survey data on respondents’ social, economic, psychological and physical well-being with contextual data on the family, neighborhood, community, school, friendships, peer groups, and romantic relationships, providing unique opportunities to study how social environments and behaviors in adolescence are linked to health and achievement outcomes in young adulthood. The fourth wave of interviews expanded the collection of biological data in Add Health to understand the social, behavioral, and biological linkages in health trajectories as the Add Health cohort ages through adulthood.

The goal was to help build a knowledge base to inform future programs and policies to promote savings and accumulation of productive assets in sub-Saharan Africa. AssetsAfrica was conducted by researchers at the Global Social Development Innovations, in partnership with the Center for Social Development (CSD) at Washington University in St. Louis and Build Africa Uganda.
<br>
<br>
AssetsAfrica used a nonequivalent groups design with pre and posttest. The study used purposive sampling. Half of the sample households were assigned to the treatment condition and the other half to the comparison condition. Baseline data were collected in August 2005 and a follow-up survey was conducted in September 2006. Data on participants’ savings and withdrawal patterns were tracked and collated using an account monitoring software called MISIDA.
<br>
<br>
Participants in the treatment group received (1) training in financial management and asset building, and (2) individual bank accounts with the Masindi branch of Stanbic Bank. Participants were expected to save into their accounts for at least six months before they were eligible for a match of 1:1. A household could receive a maximum matched fund of $285. After they reached their savings target and were matched, participants bought their desired assets (e.g., livestock, means of transport, house, land for agricultural use, and tools/equipment for small business start-ups), with the guidance of Build Africa Uganda and CSD.

The Archive of Haitian Religion and Culture: Collaborative Research and Scholarship on Haiti and the Haitian Diaspora grant, led by project director Benjamin Hebblethwaite (UF) and co-director Laurent Dubois (Duke) will improve the understanding of a central Haitian and Haitian-American spiritual tradition, the Vodou religion, by gathering the audiovisual and textual sources of communities, by interpreting the collected materials, by expanding the holdings through a self-submission tool, and by diffusing the knowledge via an open access digital library hosted within the existing Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC; www.dloc.com). The Archive of Haitian Religion and Culture: Collaborative Research and Scholarship on Haiti and the Haitian Diaspora project is part of a tradition of scholarly work stretching back to the early 20th century that has sought to counter reductionist and racist visions of Vodou religion through ethnography, analysis of culture and music, and an exploration of the role of religion in Haiti’s founding revolution (1791-1803). Such work has long turned to the central texts of worship which are Haitian Creole language songs. This three-year project will create a freely accessible multimedia digital library that uses audiovisual technologies to curate, elucidate and facilitate the advanced search of the rich primary materials of a central Haitian and Haitian-American spiritual tradition in order to promote discovery and educate a broad public. This project will provide content online for scholars and the public in the form of: Audiovisual content available as sound, photographic or video footage that will be transcribed, translated, subtitled and explicated Textual content available as facsimile, updated modernizations and translations Critical syntheses such as commentary, exegesis, etymology, etc., available in English New works obtained through the Digital Library of the Caribbean’s self-submission tool This project’s 29 different primary and interpretative materials will be presented at the first-of-its-kind Vodou Archive digital library which is dedicated to “curating and sharing the sources of Vodou religion and culture.”",2012

The project first convened a diverse group of cross-sector experts and examined available data sources to explore the underlying and complex factors influencing the national rise in pedestrian deaths. These efforts supported the development of dynamic, testable hypotheses to inform a future research agenda. This project was designed to also demonstrate an application of innovative systems science tools as a means for examining underlying drivers of complex problems and exploring effective leverage points for interventions. An initial set of systems mapping workshops with diverse stakeholders produced numerous theories involving about 40 key variables/themes related to the rise of pedestrian fatalities, many of which were further substantiated by additional data and literature scans. Additionally, hypotheses about system structures -- including balancing and reinforcing feedback loops -- thought to be accelerating or mitigating the fatality trends were uncovered.",2018-09-30

The shorter form correlated over .95 with the longer form. The form used with CAPS was the original 25 item in

Four factors emerged labeled as: self-derogation, leadership-popularity, family-parents, and assertiveness-anxiety. The family parents factor was the most stable and unambiguous.

A baseline interview was conducted among 3,327 women during the 6th to 7th month of pregnancy so that all births, including preterm births, could be identified. Subsequent surveys took place immediately after birth, then at bimonthly intervals for 24 months. From the baseline sample, there were 3,080 nontwin live births. Approximately 2,600 households were studied intensively for the full 2 years. Each survey collects detailed health, nutrition, demographic, and socioeconomic data.

Participants first completed measures of self-esteem and agreeableness. In addition, they completed a measure of the perceived risk of being the first to say “I love you.” Then, participants indicated who said “I love you” first in their relationship. Participants who indicated that they were the first to say “I love you” then completed a measure for the reasons why they did so. Similarly, participants who were not the first to say “I love you” completed a measure for the reasons why they refrained from being the first to say it . Participants then answered questions about how much they truly meant it when they told their partner “I love you” for the first time, whether they reciprocated if their partner said it first, and how far into the relationship they were when it happened as well as their confidence in this answer. Finally, participants reported demographics such as age, gender, ethnicity, relationship length, and relationship status. Additional measures included participants’ love for their partner, perceived love from their partner, relationship satisfaction, perceived partner’s self-esteem and agreeableness, attachment style, and trust in partner for exploratory purposes (e.g., to examine zero-order correlations among these variables).

Background: 103rd and 104th Congress Following the 1990 decennial census, most states redistricted for the 103rd Congress based upon the apportionment of the seats for the U.S. House of Representatives and the most recent decennial census data. For the 104th Congress, six states redistricted or through court action had either plans revised or redrawn. These states were Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina and Virginia. The 104th Congress began January 1995 and continued through the beginning of January 1997. 105th Congress The 105th Congress began January 5, 1997 and continues through the beginning of January 1999. For the 105th Congress, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas had new or revised congressional district plans. The Census Bureau retabulated demographic data from the 1990 census to accommodate any congressional district boundary changes from the previous Congress. This data is available on a separate CD-ROM from the Census Bureau Customer Service Branch (301) 457-4100. The 105th Congressional District Atlas CD-ROM provides maps showing the boundaries of the congressional districts of the 105th Congress. To meet the data needs for the 105th Congress, the Census Bureau designed this product on CD-ROM for all states. It contains maps and related entity tables in Adobe.

Less attention, however, has been paid to the conditioning effects of states’ prior financial health. Nearly always, apportioned monies cover only a fraction of the costs of federal policy reforms. The capacity of states to deploy supplementary resources, therefore, may inform the willingness of states to comply with the federal government’s policy objectives. Focusing on Barack Obama’s Race to the Top Initiative (RttT), we present new evidence that state responses to federal initiatives that carry financial rewards systematically vary with the amount of resources already on hand. States that survived the Great Recession with their education budgets largely intact, we find, tended to implement more RttT reforms overall, and especially more reforms that required substantial up-front financial commitments. These patterns of policy adoptions can be meaningfully attributed to RttT, are not the result of either prior or ancillary policy trends, and speak to the general importance of accounting for what states already have, above and beyond what the federal government is willing to offer, when studying the financial incentives of vertical diffusion.",2019-06-19

By pooling hundreds of policies we are able to estimate the average

across policies and is more consistently positive on average in states

In contrast to an emerging consensus concluding that southern African Americans materially benefited from rejoining the electorate, this study suggests that higher black registration rates actually reduced states’ poverty relief efforts. In the immediate post-VRA years, when Democrats controlled state government, the significant negative relationship between the size of the black electorate and state welfare generosity was moderated to some extent by high levels of partisan competition. In such cases Democrats ostensibly chose a “core” targeting strategy of pursuing lower-income votes and had the institutional wherewithal to purchase these votes with policy concessions. Overall, however, the liberal “Downsian” policy response to African American mobilization was dominated by an anti-redistributive response. In the South, welfare policies were relatively conservative vis-à-vis the other states during Jim Crow and became even more so in response to black voting.",2016

Even though local option sales taxes have  significant impacts on a county’s ability to fund programs and services,  little has been written about the decisions of counties to place such taxes  on the ballot. Using demographic, fiscal, and political variables, a model is  developed which explains the decision to place a county transportation  sales tax on the ballot. Modeling and analysis reveals that counties behave  strategically as the impact of demographic, fiscal, and political factors on  the decision to place a local option sales tax on the ballot is shaped by  whether the county is making an initial attempt to adopt, a subsequent  attempt to adopt after voter rejection, or a renewal attempt when an  existing local option sales tax is nearing its sunset date.",

A single stage cluster sampling procedure was used to randomly select 33 communities or barangays (17 urban, 16 rural) from the Metropolitan Cebu area. The barangays, which contained about 28,000 households, were completely surveyed in late 1982 and again in early 1983 to locate all pregnant women. Women of the selected barangays who gave birth between May 1, 1983, and April 30, 1984, are included in the sample. A baseline interview was conducted among 3,327 women during the 6th to 7th month of pregnancy so that all births, including preterm births, could be identified. Subsequent surveys took place immediately after birth, then at bimonthly intervals for 24 months. From the baseline sample, there were 3,080 nontwin live births. Approximately 2,600 households were studied intensively for the full 2 years. Each survey collects detailed health, nutrition, demographic, and socioeconomic data.
<br/><br/> Individual, household, and community data were collected during the baseline survey. Detailed community surveys of health and family planning facilities, health personnel (modern and traditional), and commercial establishments selling infant foods were undertaken on a periodic basis. A birth information survey was conducted to obtain information about the delivery and to determine birth weight, gestational age (including clinical assessment of low birth weight infants, infants of moth
ers with diabetes, and infants of mothers with no last menstrual period data). The bimonthly longitudinal surveys obtain dietary, morbidity, anthropometry, infant care, family planning, and related data. Water quality tests were conducted repeatedly over an 18-month period for all types of barangay and household water sources, and an analysis of household sources of water consumed by infants was obtained for a subsample of infants. The same subsample was used to study the etiology of diarrhea. A detailed description of this stage of the field work is provided in the Survey Procedures document.",

To be eligible, they must have been at least 18 years old and in a romantic relationship for a minimum of one year. Additionally, participants must not have been recently diagnosed with anxiety or depression, nor could they be taking steroid medication; women were pre-menopausal, not currently pregnant or nursing, not pregnant in the prior six months, and had not had an oophorectomy.

Participants screened in and consented to participate, independently, online prior to scheduling their appointment. Once scheduled, they picked up a urine collection kit at least 36 hours prior to their lab session. The day before they came to the lab, participants collected all urine their body produced for a 24 hour period. They also each independently completed a 30-45 minute online questionnaire.
<br>
<br>
Upon arrival to the lab, experimenters received the participants’ urine samples for processing, collected saliva for genotyping, participants provided baseline psychophysiological assessments and independently completed online well-being questionnaires. They then received instructions for the expressed gratitude task, independently selected a topic, in separate rooms privately used a webcam to record an expression of gratitude to the partner, received instructions for the in-person expressed gratitude conversation, had the conversation (back in the same room), and independently completed questions about it. Note that only one member of the couple expressed gratitude to the partner in person and that expresser had been randomly assigned to condition.

The research objectives were to: 
• Describe and identify modifiable determinants of HIV risk behavior and risky sexual partnerships. 
• Describe normative beliefs about HIV risk behavior, sexual partnerships, and HIV service use and their influence on personal HIV risk behavior. 
• Describe current HIV service use and preferences for HIV testing, determinants of HIV testing uptake, and, among HIV-positive participants, ART treatment uptake and adherence. 

A cross-sectional study was conducted to capture descriptive information among male sexual partners of AGYW. The study sites were the capital city of Port-au-Prince (PaP), in the south, and the city of St. Marc, in the Artibonite department (northern part of the country). These sites were purposely selected from the four active DREAMS intervention cities island-wide to represent the unique context of an urban city and one of two sites in the department of the Artibonite. 
A social and behavioral survey was applied to capture key sexual risk behaviors, social norms, and sexual relationship dynamics. In addition to general measures of sexual risk behavior (e.g., age of sexual debut, number of new sexual partners in the previous 12 months), a partnerships grid detailing information for up to three sexual partners in the previous 12 months was included. The first sexual partner discussed was the most recent AGYW. Psychosocial scales to measure important constructs were selected from established measures.",

TIGER/Line, 1992 replaces the earlier version -- TIGER/Line Files, 1990. TIGER/Line, 1992 extends the address range and ZIP Code coverage by 60 percent, identifies several new geographic areas, and includes viewing software. New Address Ranges and ZIP Codes -- Additional potential address ranges and ZIP Codes have been added based upon a match with the 1990 Census master address list. This expands the coverage to include over 80 million residential addresses (earlier versions covered only about 50 million addresses). New Geographic Areas -- TIGER/Line, 1992 adds codes for new geographic areas such as congressional districts (as of the 103rd Congress), 1990 Urbanized Areas, school districts, and new cities and towns incorporated since the 1990 Census.

Why does campaign spending vary so greatly among races for states’ highest courts?  And what can an understanding of campaign spending in these races tell us about campaign spending for other offices?  I use data from 281 state supreme court races in 21 states from 1990-2000 to answer this question.  I find that campaign spending in these races is driven by the characteristics of the race, institutional arrangements, and the electoral and state supreme court context.",2005

<br>
<br>
Upon entering the laboratory, research assistants escorted participants to private testing rooms. After confirming eligibility for the study and completing the informed consent process, participants completed the problem-generation questionnaire. Trained research assistants then affixed physiological sensors to each participant and instructed participants to relax for a 5-minute resting autonomic baseline period. After baseline, participants received instructions for the problem-focused conversation wherein one member of the dyad (the discloser) was randomly assigned to discuss one of the extradyadic problems they disclosed in the problem-generation questionnaire. The other member of the dyad (the responder) was assigned to respond to their friend/romantic partner. Severity items were summed for each problem and the discloser’s most severe problem was assigned by the experimenter for discussion. 
<br>
<br>
Additionally, dyads were assigned to one of two conditions. In the co-rumination condition (N = 90 dyads), participants were instructed to do the following: stay on topic, go over the problem multiple times, speculate about the causes and consequences of the problem, and uncover and dig into negative emotions. In the natural condition (N = 82 dyads), participants were instructed to talk about the problem as they naturally would. In both conditions, participants received cards to remind them of the instructions. Next, experimenters told participants to “gather their thoughts” for 3 min in their private testing rooms before instructing them to complete a short questionnaire regarding their appraisals of demands and coping resources for the upcoming conversation. After both participants finished the questionnaire, a foldable, sound-insulated wall separating the two private participant rooms was collapsed, and dyads engaged in an 8-minute, video-recorded conversation. After the conversation, the wall was closed and participants answered a series of questionnaires regarding co-rumination, stressed and upset feelings, rumination, and perceived partner responsiveness during the conversation. Participants completed the conversation and questionnaires again, but this time the discloser and the responder switched roles (i.e., the other person got to discuss their personal problem).

More specifically, Republicans only have an impact on toxic chemical releases when occupying executive offices.  While governors have a stronger impact, presidents have a more consistent impact, which suggests governors have more vertical and horizontal checks and balances to hurdle when implementing an anti-environmental agenda.

In this article I fill that gap by developing state party networks for 47 states from 2000 to 2016 using candidate donation data. To do this I introduce a backboning network analysis method not yet used in political science to infer relationships among donors at the state level. Finally I validate these state networks and then show how parties have varied across states and over time. The networks developed here will be made publicly available for future research.

Examining the work requirements, sanctions, time limits, and exemptions in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, we test our hypotheses using the most detailed measures of state welfare policy yet examined. Consistent with our theory, we show that policy is more generous on some dimensions and less generous on others as the size of the African American caseload increases.

In this paper, we present and analyze the most complete database of WQT programs in the United States (147 programs/policies), detailing market designs, trading mechanisms, traded pollutants, and segmented geographies in 355 distinct markets. We use hurdle models (joint binary and count regressions) to evaluate markets in concert with demographic, political, and environmental covariates. We find that only one half of markets become operational, new market establishment has declined since 2013, and market existence and prevalence has nuanced relationships with local political ideology, urban infrastructure, waterway and waterbody extents, regulated environmental impacts, and historic waterway impairment.

In a succeeding study, the items were reduced to nine, and the population was divided into scoring quartiles as follows: Extreme Conservatives, 7-9, Moderate Conservatives, 5-6, Moderate Liberals,
3-4, Liberals, 0-2.</p><p>Agreement with each item indicates conservatism.</p><p>The original measure proved to be subject to a severe problem of agreement response set, which is itself correlated with social status in the same direction as conservatism, although relations still held with controls for response set applied. Those scoring as strongly conservative proved, by comparison with the low scorers, to hold extremely conventional social attitudes, to be more responsive to naturalistic symbo
ls, and to place greater emphasis upon duty, conformity and discipline, with controls instituted for education, occupation, socioeconomic status, and possible agreement response set bias. High scorers were most frequently the uninformed, poorly educated, and significantly lower scorers in the author's measures of 'awareness' and 'intellectuality.'
</p><p>It was found that the correlations between conservatism and party affiliation and public issues tended to be low, a finding which was corroborated on a cross-national sample by Campbell et al. (1960). It was also found that the scale did discriminate significantly between Republican and Democratic party elites and the 'spectator' elites -- governalistic and academic. However, for the rank-and file citizen, there is little or no connection between a person's stand on specific political and
social issues, his party identification, his political behavior and his more general attitude toward change -- his conservative or liberal ideology. However this scale did a fairly good job of discriminating members of the public who had changed party identification from Democrat to Republican or from Republican to Democrat.
</p><p>Photiadis and Biggar found the conservatism scale to be related to religious orthodoxy and extrinsic religious belief, as well as confirming many of the earlier correlates found by McClosky.</p><p>In a more recent study, Matthews and Prothro (1966) administered five McClosky items to a large sample of southern Negroes and whites. It was found that 33% of the Negroes and only 19% of the whites sampled scored at the resistant end of the scale. Both Negroes and whites who favored change scor
ed higher on the author's Political Participation Scale although the difference was greater for Negroes than for whites. The relationship persisted even when the effects of political interest and information were statistically controlled. It is interesting to note that while a sample of southern Negro college students were found to be much more favorable toward change than the adults sampled, over two thirds of the students scored on the 'conservative' end of Campbell et al.'s Domestic Attitude Scale.

However, in understanding how states distribute education funds, little emphasis is given to partisan influences, particularly the congruence between local school districts and the state level. To test this, I collected data at the precinct level within each state, and using mapping software, spatially joined precinct boundaries to school district boundaries. Once this relationship was established, I aggregated precinct level information to school districts to understand the partisan voting patterns within each school district for elections from 2000 to 2010.

attempted to collect more information to estimate the size of the most-at-risk populations in Almaty. Community informants identified more than 850 unique sites in 2002 and more than 1,000 unique sites in 2003 as places where people meet new sexual partners, commercial sex workers solicit clients, and injection drug users socialize. Researchers interviewed 2,100 individuals at more than 250 of these sites about their risk behaviors, receptivity to HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. The results of this work, as well as in-depth analysis and recommendations for future HIV/AIDS prevention efforts, are presented in this report.
</p> <p><b>Karganda, Kazakhstan</b></p> <p>The PLACE (Priorities for Local AIDS Control Efforts) protocol was implemented in Karganda, Kazakhstan in 2002 to determine whether there was any overlap in the injecting drug user and sexual netowrks and to identify where HIV prevention efforts should focus to minimize HIV transmission. A follow-up assessment was planned for 2003 to determine to what extent AIDS prevention programs had successfully reached target sites and whether gaps remained in prog
ram coverage. This report summarizes the findings of these two assessments. Unfortunately, the interim period between assessments was not sufficient to implement the range of prevention activites anticipated, so the 2003 assessment was essentially a repeat of the 2002 assessments with some additional improvements and objectives.

The process of registering to vote, however, is error-prone and may depend on the voter’s capacity to fill a form correctly, or the election administrator’s capacity to successfully process applications as the voter registration window closes. Such errors can limit a prospective, and eligible, voter’s ability to cast a valid ballot. This study assesses the impact of time and registration source on the rates of rejected voter registration applications by analyzing monthly county-level voter registration reports during the 2012 election cycle in Florida. I find that there is a dynamic relationship between administrative and seasonal factors at the county-level, which condition the rates of rejected voter registrations as the registration deadline approaches. These findings suggest complications in the process of registering to vote that may stem from differences in voter engagement, but also the variation in administrative oversight throughout the election cycle.",2018-05-04

This article examines these two opposing effects using a nationally representative survey that includes items assessing diffuse support for state supreme courts. It uses multiple indicators to differentiate between states with highly active election systems involving large amounts of campaign activity and states with less active elections systems that involve little campaign activity. The results from the survey show that the legitimacy of elected courts is higher than appointed courts but only in states with little election activity. In states with high amounts of election activity, the legitimacy of elected courts is lower than appointed courts.",

The knowledge section of the ZSBS assessed whether or not Zambians had heard of HIV/AIDS if they knew how and how it is not transmitted, if they knew how to
prevent infection, and if they had been tested. The attitude section of the ZSBS asked respondents about their attitudes towards an HIV-infected individual: whether they should allowed to work, whether respondents would share a meal with or buy goods from such an individual, and whether a respondent would want a family member's HIV+ status kept secret. The practice section of the ZSBS asked respondents aobut their own high-risk practices: sex with a non-regular partner, having sex with an extra-marital partner, and their prevalences of other sexually transmitted infections.

The data is provided to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program by the registration offices of all States, the District of Columbia, and New York City. Data from New York, excluding New York City, were submitte
d in machine readable form. All other 1993 data were coded and keyed by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Fetal death data are limited to deaths occurring within the United States to U.S. residents and nonresidents. Fetal deaths occurring to U.S. citizens outside the United States are not included in this data file. In NCHS tabulations by place of residence, fetal deaths to nonresidents of the United States are excluded. The foreign resident records can be identified by code 4 in tape location 7 of the data tape. In addition, the majority of fetal death tables published by NCHS include only those fetal deaths with stated or presumed gestation of 20 weeks or more (see the Technical Appendix). Those records identified with a 2 in tape location 5 are included in these tabulations. All other records are excluded. Effective January 1, 1989, a revised U-S. Standard Report of Fetal Death replaced the 1978 revision. The 1989 revision provides a wide variety of new information on maternal and fetal health characteristics. Questions on complications of labor and delivery and congenital anomalies of fetus were changed from an open-ended question to a checkbox format to improve reporting of information. Several new items were added that improve the data files value for monitoring and research of factors affecting fetal mortality. The Office of Management and Budget revised its designation of metropolitan statistical areas based on figures from the 1990 Census. Effective with the 1990 data file, NCHS has been using these new definitions and codes as indicated in the listing of 320 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAS), Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAS), and New England County Metropolitan Ar
eas (NEaSS) included in this documentation. There are also 20 Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (mSAS), which are made up of PMSAS. Other geographic changes based on the 1990 Census will be implemented later. NCHS has adopted a new policy on release of vital statistics unit record data files. This new policy was implemented with the 1989 vital event files to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of individuals and institutions. As a result, this file does not contain the actual day of the death. The geographic detail is also restricted-only counties and cities of 100,000 or more population based on the 1980 Census as well as metropolitan areas of 100,000 or more population based on the 1990 Census, are identified.

There is a relationship between alcohol exposure and risky decision-making, though the enduring effects of adolescent ethanol exposure on risky decision-making in adulthood have not been fully explored.
<br>
Studies using positive reinforcement have shown that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure results in higher levels of risky decision-making in adulthood, but the effects of AIE on punishment-mediated decision-making have not been explored. Adolescent rats were exposed to AIE or saline vehicle across a 16-day period, and then allowed to mature into adulthood. They were then trained to lever press for food reward and were assessed for risky decision-making by pairing increased levels of food reward with the probability of footshock punishment. AIE did not alter punishment-mediated
risky decision-making. However, it did result in a significant increase in the delay to lever pressing. This finding is consistent with previous reports, using other behavioral tasks, which show decreased behavioral efficiency in adulthood after AIE. These findings indicate that AIE increases behavioral inefficiency, but not punishment-mediated risk-taking, in adulthood. Thus they contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the long-term effects of AIE on adult behavior.",2017-07-05

<p>
<em>Listening to Mothers in California</em>, led by the National Partnership for Women & Families, is the first state-level <em>Listening to Mothers</em> survey. This population-based survey of women who gave birth in California hospitals in 2016 was carried out by core <em>Listening to Mothers</em> investigators at the National Partnership for Women & Families and at Boston University School of Public Health, joined by investigators at what is now known as the University of California San Francisco Center for Health Equity, in collaboration with the survey research firm Quantum Market Research. California Health Care Foundation and Yellow Chair Foundation funded the survey. As investigators had access to selected birth certificate items for sampling, contacting sampled women, data weighting and data analyses, the methodology of this survey differs from the methodology used in national <em>Listening to Mothers</em> surveys. Other differences between past national surveys and this state-level survey include the ability to participate in the state survey in either English or Spanish and to participate on any device, as well as with a trained interviewer. Eligible women could participate in past national surveys in English only and either on their own with a laptop or desktop computer or by telephone with a trained interviewer.</p>

Topics included care arrangements, maternity care (and especially care during the hospital stay for giving birth), mode of birth, respectful and disrespectful treatment, postpartum experiences, and perinatal mental health (especially anxiety and depression). The public dataset is limited to items provided by survey participants while completing the survey, exclusive of personally identifiable information. For their analyses, the survey investigators have access to two additional sources of information about survey participants that cannot be made public: selected items on participants’ birth certificates and selected items abstracted from the California Department of Health Care Services Management Information System/Decision Support System Warehouse.</p>

Conventional academic wisdom suggests that people evaluate courts in nonpartisan ways, and that people make a distinction between how they evaluate individual court decisions and how they evaluate the court’s legitimacy more broadly. We challenge this idea by arguing that people’s partisan identities have a strong influence on how people evaluate the impartiality of courts, just as they do other aspects of the political world. Using original survey experiments, validated by existing observational survey data, we show that people perceive state supreme courts as being more impartial when courts issue decisions that match the ideological preferences of their preferred political party, while court decisions at odds with their party’s policy goals diminish people’s belief that courts are impartial arbiters of the law. We also show that the effects of citizen perceptions of impartiality erodes evaluations of state court legitimacy, which makes them want to limit the independence of judicial institutions.",2019-07-08

</p><p>For analysis purposes, the authors grouped the scorers into four categories: The authors note that the reaction of 'love-prejudice' was far more prevalent than the reaction of 'hate-prejudice', as indicated by the fact that among irrational replies there were many more favorable to the minority groups than unfavorable. There were three times as many among the sample in the original study (not CAPS). Rationality is highly related to educational attainment. Eight of the college graduates in
the original sample scored as 'rational' and none as 'confused', while none of the 85 respondents who had not finished high school scored as rational, and almost half scored as 'confused'. The nature of the scoring then would make it very difficult for an average American to be considered rational. When a questionnaire together with a scale of values was administered to a random sample of Radcliffe College students it was found that the Rationals tended to score high on economic and theoretical values and Irrational Pros on aesthetic and social values. Students in the sciences were more Rational, those in humanities more Irrational Pro.
</p><p>Irrational Pro Irrational Anti Rationalist low low Irrational Pro high low Irrational Anti low high Confused high high</p><p>The low-high dividing line in each scale was the score (here 48) which indicates the respondent answers half the items in the rational direction and half in the irrational direction. Since the respondent indicates not only his choice but also how sure he feels about his choice, the range of scores for each item is as follows: Rational answers = 1 No answer = 2 Irrat
ional answer (not very sure) = 3 Irrational answer (moderately sure) = 4 Irrational answer (very sure) = 5 Total scores for both the Irrational Pro and the Irrational
Anti items thus run between 24 (most rational) and 120 (most irrational).

Voter’s knowledge about voter fraud allegations likely comes through the media, who tend to sensationalize the issue. In this study, we argue that the more voters are exposed to media coverage of voter fraud allegations, the more likely that they will perceive that voter fraud is a frequent problem. We merge the 2012 Survey of Performance of American Elections with state-level media coverage of voter fraud leading up to the 2012 election. Our results show that media coverage of voter fraud is associated with public beliefs about voter fraud. In states where fraud was more frequently featured in local media outlets, public concerns about voter fraud were heightened.   In particular, we find that press attention to voter fraud has a larger influence on Republicans than Democrats and Independents. We further find that media coverage of voter fraud does not further polarize partisan perceptions of voter fraud. Rather, political interest moderates state media coverage on voter fraud beliefs only among Republicans. Lastly, our results provide no support that demographic changes, approval of election administration, or information concerning actual reported voting irregularities have any discernable effects on partisan perceptions.",2018-01-22

Traditionally, safety and injury analysis has occurred in siloed fields, with road safety researchers relying predominately on police-recorded crash reports, and public health researchers relying on hospitalization records. Depending on the context of the study and the database used, findings vary. This is the case for the micro-level (e.g., injury severity of an individual) to the macro-level (e.g., injury rate) scale.

This project begins to map disparate data sets to inform questions surrounding crashes. The data-mapping process will aim to build linkages between police-crash datasets and other datasets (i.e., incident-oriented data, spatial data, emerging datasets) and scale it up to larger geographic areas. Efforts to augment crash data are not new. A notable health-oriented example which sought to link health and police records was the Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System (CODES). Although this federal program ended in 2013, some states, including California, North Carolina, and Tennessee, have continued this effort.

Added data and analytics resulted in a more “complete picture” of crashes and injuries. This complete picture enables researchers to improve their modeling, assist policy makers, and contribute to visualization that helps tell compelling safety stories that guide safety improvements.

Half of the qualitative interviews will be conducted by ECU. The main quantitative survey will be conducted by ECU. Qualitative analysis will be conducted by University of Glasgow. The qualitative study will inform the design of the quantitative study. Quantitative analysis will be conducted by Florida International University. University College London will conduct a small pilot experiment also using Qualtrics Panels. 
<p><p>
BACKGROUND
Tobacco, alcohol, and sugar consumption contribute to cancer burden. An evidence-based population-level intervention to reduce intake of tobacco, alcohol, and sugar-added products is the implementation of policies that increase their price. This can be done through excise taxes, mitigation fees, bans on discounts, and minimum prices. Yet, the adoption of these evidence-based policies has received only limited traction, and public support is undermined by industry-led efforts to oppose policy interventions. This proposal is guided by a working hypothesis that public acceptance of different tax and non-tax pricing interventions for cancer risk behaviors varies by: (a) policy type, (b) the way the message is framed, and (c) the cancer-causing product it addresses.
<p>
AIMS
We examine this working hypothesis through specific aims to: (1) identify and optimize ways to communicate price policy options for cancer-causing products to the public and (2) explore the effects of policy type, frames, and behavioural domain on public policy support.
<p>
PARTICIPANTS
Participants in the interview stage (qualitative) will be: 6 members of the public, 6 cancer survivors, and 6 cancer policy advocates – half of each stakeholder group will be in each country. Participants in the quantitative study will be solicited by Qualtrics's Survey Panels service (n=1800).
<p>
METHODS
This project will use a mixed-methods approach to understand the framing of tax and non- tax pricing policy interventions to reduce consumption of cancer-causing products. We will conduct formative qualitative research with stakeholders, identify frames to test, and pilot the frames in a quantitative study. We will then implement a 3x3x4 factorial experiment to assess the impact of the frames, cancer-causing products discussed, and pricing policy options on support for policies among UK and US adults.",2019-04-12

I argue that trust in state government has distinctive origins, tied to differences in how states operate within a federal system of government.  Leveraging variations in the character of the states, I consider whether trust in state government is a function of its proximity to citizens, people’s relative preferences for smaller government, and the homogeneity of state electorates.  Using responses to the 2017 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, I show feelings of trust in state government follow not only from state political conditions and economic performance, but also the distinctive character of the states.  These findings challenge prior accounts that argue that diffuse trust in state government reflects only how people feel about the national government, and highlight how large states and small states face different challenges in cultivating trust in state government.",

We hypothesize that minorities will be more likely to serve in appointed positions as governors consider diversity in making appointments and less likely to serve in elected positions due to the additional hurdles for candidates of color. Using an original dataset of state executive leaders from 2001 to 2017 from all 50 states, we find evidence that institutional design influences levels of diversity among state executive leaders. Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be appointed than elected to state executive leadership positions. Additionally, we find that Democratic governors are more likely than Republican governors to appoint minorities. Ultimately, this evidence is important for understanding how institutional design can have consequences for descriptive representation, specifically for groups that have been historically excluded from political life.",

The respondents are asked to report how frequently they experience specific symptoms of anxiety before, during, and after examinations. In addition to measuring individual differences in anxiety proneness in t
est situations, the TAI subscales assess worry and emotionality as major components of text anxiety.
</p><p>Persons who are high in test anxiety tend to perceive evaluative situations as personally threatening. In test situations they are often tense, apprehensive, nervous, and emotionally aroused. Moreover, the negative self-centered worry cognitions which they experience distract their attention and interfere with concentration during examinations. Research indicates that these worry reactions contribute to the performance decrements of test-anxious students on cognitive-intellectual tasks (L
eibert and Morris, 1967). Although developed to measure test anxiety in high school and college students, the TAI has been used successfully with junior high school students. It is similar in concept and structure to the A-Trait Scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which measures general anxiety proneness in adolescents and adults. Leibert and Morris (1967), having identified worry and emotionality as the two major components of test anxiety, define worry as cognitive concerns about the consequences of failure and emotionality as reactions of the autonomic nervous system that are evoked by evaluative stress. Worry and emotionality may also be thought of as major components of the state-anxiety reactions experienced in test situations, including tension, apprehension, nervousness, and arousal of the autonomic nervous system (Spielberger et al., 1978). The construction and development of the TAI was guided by these concepts of worry and emotionality.

angladesh has invested in a maternal health program with support from a number of development partners. Committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5, Bangladesh’s targets are to reduce the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to 143 per 100,000 live births by 2015, and to increase skilled attendance at birth to 50 percent by 2016. In the last decade, the health, nutrition, and population sector program of Bangladesh has adopted a national strategy for maternal health focusing on Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) for reducing maternal mortality, focusing especially on early detection and appropriate referral of complications, and improvement of quality of care. Since 2001, the government embarked on program to retrain existing government community health care workers as Community Skilled Birth Attendants (CSBA) as the primary operational strategy for achieving the 2015 target of 50 percent skilled attendance at birth.
</p>  <p>The second Bangladesh Maternal Mortality and Health Care Survey was conducted in 2010 (BMMS 2010) with the major objectives being to provide a maternal mortality estimate for the period 2008-2010, to determine whether MMR has significantly declined from 1998-2001, and to ascertain the causes of maternal death. The first such national level survey was conducted in 2001 (BMMS 2001).</p>  <p>The survey was carried out in a national sample of 175,000 households, interviewing ever-married wo
men 13 to 49, as well as investigating any deaths to women of reproductive ages, especially maternal and pregnancy-related deaths. Data collection for the survey was conducted from 18 January to 6 August, 2010.

Five measures of party competition are used: (1) the number of recent shifts of party control, (2) an index of party competition for state offices, (3) the closeness of presidential elections in the state, (4) the effective number of political parties in the state, and (5) the ratio of Republicans to Democrats in the electorate.

People take cues from elites and as a result, alter their preferences based on those elite cues. In particular, self-identified Republicans and conservatives are more suspicious of scientists and academics, and more likely to dismiss or disbelieve scientific findings. We apply these findings in the context of attitudes about concussion-related injuries in sports. We theorize that groups predisposed against academics and scientists will be less likely to believe in connections between head injuries and organized sports. Using a nationally representative survey conducted in 2016, we find strong support for our theory. There is widespread of acceptance of that concussions and head injuries are a problem in sports with 65% saying they are a major problem and 29% saying minor problem. Attitudes about the dangers of brain injuries and acceptance of new scientific findings are divided by party identification, especially among those with the highest levels of political knowledge. Further, attitudes about new science on concussions are related to attitudes about climate change. These findings have broad implications for how scientific issues are politicized in the United States in the contemporary era.",2018-09-16

Part 1 built an in-depth understanding of educational, workplace, career and retention issues faced by LIS graduates using the life course perspective from the social sciences. This part of the research was sited in North Carolina where a full range of LIS program types exist. One of the programs is in a historically Black institution, allowing a focus on minority career and retention issues. Part 2 used the methods developed in Part 1 to generate a transferable model for career tracking of LIS graduates nationally.  In Part 1, the study developed a comprehensive web-based survey to collect data on the long term career patterns of those who graduated from LIS programs in North Carolina.  The survey collected data on the educational and career histories of respondents, as well as data related to demographics, specific jobs held, breaks in employment, continuing education, opinions about trends in LIS, satisfaction with LIS as a career and perspectives of recent graduates about their LIS programs and entry into the workforce. Respondents were asked to identify up to five specific jobs in terms of the following categories: job immediately before their LIS program, job immediately after their LIS program, current job or last job depending on employment status, longest job and highest-achieving job.

Although most Americans indicate that they would prefer greater equality, redistributive policies aimed at reducing inequality are frequently unpopular. Traditional accounts posit that attitudes toward redistribution are driven by economic self-interest or ideological principles. From a social psychological perspective, however, we expected that subjective comparisons to others may be a more relevant form of self-interest than material wealth. We hypothesized that participants would support redistribution more when they felt low in subjective status than when they felt high, even when actual resources and self-interest were held constant. Moreover, we predicted that people would legitimize these shifts in policy attitudes by appealing selectively to ideological principles concerning fairness. In four studies we found correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Studies 2 - 4) evidence that subjective status motivates shifts in support for redistributive policies along with the ideological principles that justify them.",2014-09-09

There, we took baseline recordings of physiological activity, then the participants participated in a series of structured videorecorded conversations about everyday topics, and privately answered brief questionnaires on a laptop after each conversation. Psychophysiology was also assessed during these conversations. Topics were:
<br>-	How the couple first met (joint conversation).
<br>-	Disclosure of a negative personal event (each couple-member disclosed, giving each couple-member a chance to provide support).
<br>-	Disclosure of a positive personal event (each couple-member disclosed, giving each couple-member a chance to respond to the capitalization situation).

This article examines whether the presence of women in prominent political office leads to an increase in the number of women serving in state legislatures. Contrary to previous work on this topic, we find that the effect of electing women to prominent  office on the subsequent gender composition of state legislatures is partisan in nature. Using an original dataset covering the years 1975 through 2019, we test whether the proportion of women serving in state legislatures increases as a result of either the number of women elected to prominent office in a state or the length of a state’s history of electing women to these positions. We find that the effects diverge by partisanship. The election of prominent Democratic women leads to an increase in the proportion of Democratic women state legislators, while the election of Republican women leads to a decrease in the proportion of Republican women state legislators. Rather than serving as role models for women of both parties to enter the political pipeline, electing more women to prominent office is contributing to a greater representational  gap between the parties in state legislatures.",

Scholars have long argued that increased levels of party competition are associated with more liberal policymaking. By this logic, parties in close competition with one another try to expand their bases of support by catering to the desires of those who tend to abstain from the political process -- the ""have-nots."" We extend this classic hypothesis by examining the relationship between competition and policy liberalism over several decades, articulating and testing a theory that suggests that party competition relates differently to social and economic policy liberalism. We find robust evidence that increased competition has a positive relationship with economic policy liberalism, weaker evidence for a negative relationship between competition and social policy liberalism, and suggestive evidence that the direction and magnitudes of these relationships have changed over time.",

The D10 yielded a reproducibility coefficient (CR) of .83. Although not as high as the .90 which Guttman recommended, this CR was claimed to be as high as one could get using
a 10-item subset of the D-Scale. The author attributes the low CR to the intrusion of variables such as anxiety, rigidity, authoritarianism, self-rejection and paranoia. Hence, this scale is not multidimensional, but neither is the original D-Scale.

Part 1 built an in-depth understanding of educational, workplace, career and retention issues faced by LIS graduates using the life course perspective from the social sciences. This part of the research was sited in North Carolina where a full range of LIS program types exist. One of the programs is in a historically Black institution, allowing a focus on minority career and retention issues. Part 2 used the methods developed in Part 1 to generate a transferable model for career tracking of LIS graduates nationally.  In Part 1, the study developed a comprehensive web-based survey to collect data on the long term career patterns of those who graduated from LIS programs in North Carolina.  The survey collected data on the educational and career histories of respondents, as well as data related to demographics, specific jobs held, breaks in employment, continuing education, opinions about trends in LIS, satisfaction with LIS as a career and perspectives of recent graduates about their LIS programs and entry into the workforce. Respondents were asked to identify up to five specific jobs in terms of the following categories: job immediately before their LIS program, job immediately after their LIS program, current job or last job depending on employment status, longest job and highest-achieving job.

</p> <p>--------</p> <p> The 1998 Zambia Sexual Behavior Survey (ZSBS) collected information on key indicators of HIV/AIDS/STD-related indicators of knowledge, attitude, and sexual behavior. The population-based survey consisted of a national sample of 1943 households, 97% of which responded. Individual response rates among eligible men and women were 92% and 96%, respectively. This 95-page report summarizes the ZSBS findings. Some key findings: virtually all respondents had heard of AIDS, and 8
6% of men and 78% of women thought that HIV infection could be avoided. Two-thirds of men and 57% of women agreed that condom use was an
effective prevention method. Only 7% of respondents thought it was acceptable for a married man to have extra-marital sexual relations, but 19% of men and 29% of women thought a man could not be sexually satisfied with just one partner. One in five adults were estimated to be HIV positive by 1995; however, few people knew their HIV status, and many held negative attitudes about HIV-positive people. Sexual behavior in Zambia had not changed drastically from 1996 to 1998, though unmarried men did report fewer partners. Close to one-thid of men reported using condoms in non-marital relationships, a slight decrease from 1996.

A group of four pups—always two male and two female pups from the same mother—are recorded for at least 60 seconds and a spectrum analysis done on the sounds.  All pups belong to the same treatment (or “exposure”) group, determined by what was done to their mother.  The treatments are: untreated (UN), cocaine in IV (CC) and saline in IV (CS).     Recordings are taken on Days 1, 3 and 5.  (Day 1 is the day of the pups’ birth.)  These are the same days used in the Retrieval experiment.

We take advantage of Washington’s 2012 charter school ballot initiative—the first voter-approved charter initiative in the U.S.—to shed light on the politics of school choice at the mass level. Since in-depth, individual-level voter data is often unavailable in state-level elections, we leverage extensive precinct- and district-level data to examine patterns of support and opposition toward the charter school initiative, focusing on how partisanship, ideology, and demographic factors serve to unify or divide voters. Our analysis reveals that the coalition of supporters cut across usual partisan and demographic cleavages, producing somewhat strange bedfellows. This finding has important implications for the strategies advocacy groups may consider as they seek to expand or limit school choice programs via ballot initiatives as opposed to the statehouse and provides suggestive evidence regarding the evolving shapers of voter support for school choice and ballot initiatives more generally.",2017-09-05

WILIS 1 had two major parts. Part 1 built an in-depth understanding of educational, workplace, career and retention issues faced by LIS graduates using the life course perspective from the social sciences. This part of the research was sited in North Carolina where a full range of LIS program types exist. One of the programs is in a historically Black institution, allowing a focus on minority career and retention issues. Part 2 used the methods developed in Part 1 to generate a transferable model for career tracking of LIS graduates nationally.  In Part 1, the study developed a comprehensive web-based survey to collect data on the long term career patterns of those who graduated from LIS programs in North Carolina.  The survey collected data on the educational and career histories of respondents, as well as data related to demographics, specific jobs held, breaks in employment, continuing education, opinions about trends in LIS, satisfaction with LIS as a career and perspectives of recent graduates about their LIS programs and entry into the workforce. Respondents were asked to identify up to five specific jobs in terms of the following categories: job immediately before the
ir LIS program, job immediately after their LIS program, current job or last job depending on employment status, longest job and highest-achieving job. The response rate for the WILIS 1 study was 35% (n=2660).",2012

region-specific prices and community infrastructure data. Phase II data have been collected annually (with two exceptions) since 1994.

Thus, the interviewer was instructed to speak with ""the person who knows the most about this family's shop

In practice, however, some individuals, such as very young children and elderly people, did not receive an individual interview.

It was produced by the U.S. Bureau of the Census under contract with the Louisiana Population Data Center, LSU Agricultural Center. PUMS-L contains a unique labor market area (LMA) geography delineated by Charles M. Tolbert (LSU) and Molly Sizer (University of Arkansas). PUMS-L is a minimum 0.25 percent sample. Like all PUMS geographic units, the labor market areas must have a
population of at least 100,000 persons. To avoid having as few as 250 cases in smaller LMAs, the Bureau made an effort to supply at least 2000 person records per LMA. Inclusion of these additional person records resulted in a 0.45 percent sample. Sampling weights are included in the file that compensate for this oversampling of smaller LMAs. The resulting file contains information on 519,237 households and 1,139,142 persons. Weighted totals are: households - 101,916,857, persons - 248,709,867. This CD-ROM edition of PUMS-L was prepared and mastered by the Louisiana Population Data Center. The files on this CD-ROM are organized in several directories. These directories contain raw PUMS-L data files, equivalency files that document the labor market area geography, Atlas Graphics files that can be used to produce maps, and compressed, rectangularized SAS and SPSS-PC system files. One of the SAS files is an experienced civilian labor force extract that may facilitate research on labor market issues. Also included are SAS and SPSS programs configured for PUMS-L.

However, applying the traditional electoral RDD to the study of divided government is challenging. Because assignment to treatment in this case is the result of elections to multiple institutions, there is no obvious single forcing variable. Here we use simulations in which we apply shocks to real-world election results in order to generate two measures of the likelihood of divided government, both of which can be used for causal analysis. The first captures the electoral distance to divided government and can easily be utilized in conjunction with the standard sharp RDD toolkit. The second is a simulated probability of divided government. This measure does not easily fit into a sharp RDD framework, so we develop a probability restricted design (PRD) which relies upon the underlying logic of an RDD. This design incorporates common regression techniques but limits the sample to to those observations for which assignment to treatment approaches “as-if random.” To illustrate both of our approaches, we reevaluate the link between divided government and the size of budget deficits.",

Yet almost nothing is known about the consequences of the institution that has the greatest singular impact on the turnout and composition of the electorate: election timing. We argue that off-cycle elections will tend to produce governments that are not well-aligned with the political preferences of their median constituent. To empirically test this expectation, we examine the relationship between election timing and mass-elite congruence across local school district governments. Leveraging variation in election timing across districts within the same state, we find that board members are more likely to hold political preferences that are aligned with their constituents when boards are elected in on- versus off-cycle races. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the study of representation and election timing, suggesting some possible avenues for future research.",

These effects are measured by a variety of means: detailed monitoring of individuals' health status and dietary intake, precise measurement of household-level expenditures and service utilization, and collection of relevant community-level data, including
region-specific prices and community infrastructure data. Phase II data have been collected annually (with two exceptions) since 1994. The project has been run jointly by the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, headed by Barry M. Popkin, and the Demoscope team in Russia, headed by Polina Kozyreva and Mikhail Kosolapov.
</p>  <b>Please note</b> <p>The sample size in 2014 was cut by about 20%, because the cost of the project increased due to inflation, but financial support remained the same. The original 1994 sample remained the same, and all cuts applied only to the part of the sample which was added in 2010. It should be stated that the implemented procedure of cutting the sample size guarantees that the smaller sample is still representative at the national level. To lower the cost it was also decided to dro
p the Educational Expenses section from the HH questionnaire, which was added back in 2010.
</p>   <b>Household Data</b> <p>For the household interview, a single member of the household was asked questions that pertained to the entire family. The respondent was usually the oldest living woman in the home since she was available to be interviewed during the daytime. Any attempt to identify one person as the ""household head"" is as problematic in Russia as it is in the United States. Thus, the interviewer was instructed to speak with ""the person who knows the most about this family's shop
ping and health.""</p>  <b>Individual Data</b> <p>In theory, the individual questionnaire is administered to every person living in the household. In practice, however, some individuals, such as very young children and elderly people, did not receive an individual interview. Individual-level information is the primary source of information pertaining to a person's health, employment status, demographic characteristics, and anthropometry. It can also be used to supplement household-level income an

It is designed to serve as a convenient volume for statistical reference and as a guide to other statistical publications and sources. The latter function is served by the introductory text to each section, the source note appearing below each table, and Appendix I, which comprises the Guide to Sources of Statisti
cs, the Guide to State Statistical Abstracts, and the Guide to Foreign Statistical Abstracts. The Statistical Abstract sections and tables are compiled into one Adobe PDF named StatAbstract2009.pdf. This PDF is bookmarked by section and by table and can be searched using the Acrobat Search feature. The Statistical Abstract on CD-ROM is best viewed using Adobe Acrobat 5, or any subsequent version of Acrobat or Acrobat Reader. The Statistical Abstract tables and the metropolitan areas tables from Appendix II are available as Excel(.xls or .xlw) spreadsheets. In most cases, these spreadsheet files offer the user direct access to more data than are shown either in the publication or Adobe Acrobat. These files usually contain more years of data, more geographic areas, and/or more categories of subjects than those shown in the Acrobat version. The extensive selection of statistics is provided for the United States, with selected data for regions, divisions, states, metropolitan areas, cities, and foreign countries from reports and records of government and private agencies. Software on the disc can be used to perform full-text searches, view official statistics, open tables as Lotus worksheets or Excel workbooks, and link directly to source agencies and organizations for supporting information. Except as indicated, figures are for the United States as presently constituted. Although emphasis in the Statistical Abstract is primarily given to national data, many tables present data for regions and individual states and a smaller number for metropolitan areas and cities.Statistics for the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico and for island areas of the United States are included in many state tables and are supplemented by information in Section 29. Additional information for states, cities, counties, metropolitan areas, and other small units, as well as more historical data are available in various supplements to the Abstract. Statistics in this edition are generally for the most recent year or period available by summer 2006. Each year over 1,400 tables and charts are reviewed and evaluated; new tables and charts of current interest are added, continuing series are updated, and less timely data are condensed or eliminated. Text notes and appendices are revised as appropriate. This year we have introduced 72 new tables covering a wide range of subject areas. These cover a variety of topics including: learning disability for children, people impacted by the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast area, employees with alternative work arrangements, adult computer and Internet users by selected characteristics, North America cruise industry, women- and minority-owned businesses, and the percentage of the adult population considered to be obese. Some of the annually surveyed topics are population; vital statistics; health and nutrition; education; law enforcement, courts and prison; geography and environment; elections; state and local government; federal government finances and employment; national defense and veterans affairs; social insurance and human services; labor force, employment, and earnings; income, expenditures, and wealth; prices; business enterprise; science and technology; agriculture; natural resources; energy; construction and housing; manufactures; domestic trade and services; transportation; information and communication; banking, finance, and insurance; arts, entertainment, and recreation; accommodation, food services, and other services; foreign commerce and aid; outlying areas; and comparative international statistics.""

6,https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/12255,,"We are interested in the spatial distribution of fossil-fuel-related emissions of CO2 for both geochemical and geopolitical reasons, but it is important to understand the uncertainty that exists in spatially explicit emissions estimates.  Working from one of the widely-used gridded data sets of CO2 emissions, we examine the elements of uncertainty, focusing on gridded data for the U.S. at the scale of 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude.  Uncertainty is introduced in the magnitude of total U.S. emissions, the magnitude and location of large point sources, the magnitude and distribution of non-point sources, and from the use of proxy data to characterize emissions.  For the U.S. we develop estimates of the contribution of each component of uncertainty.  At 1 degree resolution, in most grid cells, the largest contribution to uncertainty comes from how well the distribution of the proxy (in this case population density) represents the distribution of emissions.  In other grid cells the magnitude and location of large point sources make the major contribution to uncertainty.  Uncertainty in population density can be important where a large gradient in population density occurs near a grid cell boundary.  Uncertainty
is strongly scale-dependent with uncertainty increasing as grid size decreases.  Uncertainty for our data set with one degree grid cells for the U.S. is typically on the order of +/- 150%, but this is perhaps not excessive in a data set where emissions per grid cell vary over 8 orders of magnitude.",2016-03-30

In 2012 and later years this design will be repeated. Each GSS will thus 1) start a new 4-year/3-wave panel, 2) be in the middle of a 4-year/3-wave panel, and 3) finish a still earlier 4-year/3-wave panel.

To evaluate the impact of these program efforts, MEASURE Evaluation designed two independent but complementary studies: the Social Support study and the TB-HIV Integration study.

These datasets contain Phase 2 data for the Social Support study. The study employed a mixed-methods approach, with a quasi-experimental quantitative evaluation design complemented by qualitative descriptive work to inform the findings. Data collection included surveys of medical facilities, patient chart abstraction, and provider, patient, and project staff in-depth interviews. TB diagnosis and treatment data were abstracted from medical records for five cohorts of TB patients to provide data on patients at high risk for defaulting on TB treatment, including those who did and did not receive any social support, patients at low risk for defaulting, and patients seen during 2014 and 2015. Data on risk distribution in the population of TB patients were abstracted from charts of patients seen in TB facilities during 2014 and 2014. Datasets include data from patient’s chart abstraction, health facility and Ukrainian Red Cross Society regional offices surveys as well as transcripts from in-depth interviews with patients, providers and project staff. Phase 2 data were collected in 2016.

<p><b>[Description]</b></p>
<p>In late 2017, a group of state, local, tribal, regional, and federal air planning agencies initiated a collaborative process to build a national emissions modeling platform (EMP) for simulating air quality in the U.S. The 2016beta EMP is the first product from the National Emissions Inventory Collaborative that includes a full suite of base year (2016) and future year inventories, ancillary emissions data, and scripts and software for preparing the emissions for air quality modeling.</p>
<p>A coordination workgroup, ten sector workgroups, and a modeling workgroup were staffed by over 245 state and regional air agency, EPA, and Federal Land Manager employees. The work of the sector workgroups to build 2016 base year and future year inventories is documented in a series of sector-specific specification sheets below. These specification sheets detail the origin of the inventories and ancillary data used to simulate criteria pollutant, and in many cases hazardous air pollutant, emissions for the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.  </p>

<p>The summary stacked bar plots below compare U.S. total criteria pollutant emissions for the 2016beta platform back to 2011 and 2014 base and future year emissions.  </p>

<p><b>[Download]</b></p>
<p>Disclaimer: The 2016beta emissions inventories and ancillary data are draft data. The Collaborative intends to use the 2016beta platform to evaluate the emissions data and air quality modeling results derived from these data towards the development of a 2016 version 1 emissions modeling platform. Users of these data acknowledge that they are distributed as is, and that they have not been extensively evaluated by the Collaborative.  </p>

<p>The initial release of the 2016beta platform is for the year 2016 only. Click here to download it from the Intermountain West Data Warehouse.  </p>

29756,https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/YHLLZG,,"<b>Abstract</b><br>
<b>Rationale</b> Early onset of alcohol drinking has been associated
with alcohol abuse in adulthood. The neurobiology of this
phenomenon is unclear, but mesolimbic dopamine pathways,
which are dynamic during adolescence, may play a role.<br>
<b>Objectives</b> We investigated the impact of adolescent bingelike
alcohol on phasic dopaminergic neurotransmission during
adulthood.<br>
<b>Methods</b>
Rats received intermittent intragastric ethanol, water,
or nothing during adolescence. In adulthood, electrically
evoked dopamine release and subsequent uptake were measured
in the nucleus accumbens core at baseline and after
acute challenge of ethanol or saline.<br>
<b>Results</b>
Adolescent ethanol exposure did not alter basal measures
of evoked dopamine release or uptake. Ethanol challenge
dose-dependently decreased the amplitude of evoked
dopamine release in rats by 30–50 % in control groups, as
previously reported, but did not alter evoked release in
ethanol-exposed animals. To address the mechanismby which
ethanol altered dopamine signaling, the evoked signals were
modeled to estimate dopamine efflux per impulse and the
velocity of the dopamine transporter. Dopamine uptake was
slower in all exposure groups after ethanol challenge
compared to saline, while dopamine efflux per pulse of electrical
stimulation was reduced by ethanol only in ethanolnaive
rats.<br>
<b>Conclusions</b> The results demonstrate that exposure to binge
levels of ethanol during adolescence blunts the effect of ethanol
challenge to reduce the amplitude of phasic dopamine
release in adulthood. Large dopamine transients may result
in more extracellular dopamine after alcohol challenge in
adolescent-exposed rats and may be one mechanism by which
alcohol is more reinforcing in people who initiated drinking at
an early age.

This study is among the first to consider the policy consequences of sectionalism in state bureaucracies. We test our claims by employing a mixed methods approach that analyzes each instance of litigation and intervention by state bureaucrats in opposition to actions and orders by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from 2010–2017. We find that, all else equal, state agency resistance to federal utility policy is more than four times as likely among Southern utility regulators.

When individuals in a group have incentives to hoard information the group may be less effective in achieving its goals. Mixed motives both to communicate and accumulate information create a 'social dilemma' in which group and individual goals are in conflict. A series of four units PUZZLE1-4 examined the ways in which communication patterns in networks are distorted by incentives to save information. The vulnerability of communication networks
to this type of conflict should be a function of the distribution of information in the network. Networks are assumed to be more vulnerable when they have a small number of potentially competing centers and less vulnerable when there is either one clearly central position or the network is decentralized in its distribution of information. this work will unite social psychological approaches to social dilemmas with sociological work on social networks.

It is designed to serve as a convenient volume for statistical reference and as a guide to other statistical publications and sources. The latter function is served by the introductory text to each section, the source note appearing below each table, and Appendix I, which comprises the Guide to Sources of Statisti
cs, the Guide to State Statistical Abstracts, and the Guide to Foreign Statistical Abstracts. The Statistical Abstract sections and tables are compiled into one Adobe PDF named StatAbstract2007.pdf. This PDF is bookmarked by section and by table and can be searched using the Acrobat Search feature. The Statistical Abstract on CD-ROM is best viewed using Adobe Acrobat 5, or any subsequent version of Acrobat or Acrobat Reader. The Statistical Abstract tables and the metropolitan areas tables from Appendix II are available as Excel(.xls or .xlw) spreadsheets. In most cases, these spreadsheet files offer the user direct access to more data than are shown either in the publication or Adobe Acrobat. These files usually contain more years of data, more geographic areas, and/or more categories of subjects than those shown in the Acrobat version. The extensive selection of statistics is provided for the United States, with selected data for regions, divisions, states, metropolitan areas, cities, and foreign countries from reports and records of government and private agencies. Software on the disc can be used to perform full-text searches, view official statistics, open tables as Lotus worksheets or Excel workbooks, and link directly to source agencies and organizations for su
pporting information. Except as indicated, figures are for the United States as presently constituted. Although emphasis in the Statistical Abstract is primarily given to national data, many tables present data for regions and individual states and a smaller number for metropolitan areas and cities.Statistics for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and for island areas of the United States are included in many state tables and are supplemented by information in Section 29. Additional information for states, cities, counties, metropolitan areas, and other small units, as well as more historical data are available in various supplements to the Abstract. Statistics in this edition are generally for the most recent year or period available by summer 2006. Each year over 1,400 tables and charts are reviewed and evaluated; new tables and charts of current interest are added, continuing series are updated, and less timely data are condensed or eliminated. Text notes and appendices are revised as appropriate. This year we have introduced 72 new tables covering a wide range of subject areas. These cover a variety of topics including: learning disability for children, people impacted by the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast area, employees with alternative work arrangements, adult computer and Internet users by selected characteristics, North America cruise industry, women- and minority-owned businesses, and the percentage of the adult population considered to be obese. Some of the annually surveyed topics are population; vital statistics; health and nutrition; education; law enforcement, courts and prison; geography and environment; elections; state and local government; federal government finances and employment; national defense and veterans affairs; social insurance and human services; labor force, employment, and earnings; income, expenditures, and wealth; prices; business enterprise; science and technology; agriculture; natural resources; energy; construction and housing; manufactures; domestic trade and services; transportation; information and communication; banking, finance, and insurance; arts, entertainment, and recreation; accommodation, food services, and other services; foreign commerce and aid; outlying areas; and comparative international statistics.""

The number of observations in each data set does not necessarily match the total number of observations in the original data files. For the economics data sets, filter criteria were established so that only families with complete economic information were included. The health data sets used the maximum number of non-missing observations per individual analysis. Thus, the health data sets vary in composition more than do the economics ones.

The database identifies the candidates who ran for local or state-wide prosecutorial office. It also identifies who contributed to prosecutor elections and the amount of their donations. Campaign contribution information is often publicly available, but the format of that information varies from state to state, the information is often scattered across multiple sources and the information is sometimes incomplete. This single nationwide database will allow sustained study about who contributes to prosecutor campaigns and the amount of contributions.

The current analysis examines the comparability of results between observations and exit interviews on selected indicators using data from three countries (Ecuador, Uganda, and Zimbabwe). These two instruments differ somewhat in the type of information collected, yet there is considerable overlap. For example, observation is better at measuring accuracy of information during counseling and technical competence of the provider, whereas exit interviews provide the client's perspective on the services received. However, the two converge when clients report on the providers' actions during counseling and clinical examination. The researchers compared frequencies on selected indicators available from both instruments and calculated Kappa coefficients for agreement after linking data from observation and exit interviews for the same client. Although levels would vary across countries for a given indicator, within a country results were consistent between instruments. Agreement was good to excellent on many of the indicators. These data provide evidence that the QIQ is a reliable means of monitoring QC in family planning programs. Moreover, a number of the QC indicators can be obtained from either data collection method, raising the question of whether full implementation of both instruments is always needed. Although some programs may opt for one instrument over the other due to resource constraints, the combination provides a fuller assessment of QC.",

The current analysis examines the comparability of results between observations and exit interviews on selected indicators using data from three countries (Ecuador, Uganda, and Zimbabwe). These two instruments differ somewhat in the type of information collected, yet there is considerable overlap. For example, observation is better at measuring accuracy of information during counseling and technical competence of the provider, whereas exit interviews provide the client's perspective on the services received. However, the two converge when clients report on the providers' actions during counseling and clinical examination. The researchers compared frequencies on selected indicators available from both instruments and calculated Kappa coefficients for agreement after linking data from observation and exit interviews for the same client. Although levels would vary across countries for a given indicator, within a country results were consistent between instruments. Agreement was good to excellent on many of the indicators. These data provide evidence that the QIQ is a reliable means of monitoring QC in family planning programs. Moreover, a number of the QC indicators can be obtained from either data collection method, raising the question of whether full implementation of both instruments is always needed. Although some programs may opt for one instrument over the other due to resource constraints, the combination provides a fuller assessment of QC.",

The Add Health cohort has been followed into young adulthood with four in-home interviews, the most recent in 2008, when the sample was aged 24-32*. Add Health combines longitudinal survey data on respondents’ social, economic, psychological and physical well-being with contextual data on the family, neighborhood, community, school, friendships, peer groups, and romantic relationships, providing unique opportunities to study how social environments and behaviors in adolescence are linked to health and achievement outcomes in young adulthood.

These effects are measured by a variety of means: detailed monitoring of individuals' health status and dietary intake, precise measurement of household-level expenditures and service utilization, and collection of relevant community-level data, including
region-specific prices and community infrastructure data. Phase II data have been collected annually (with two exceptions) since 1994.

Part 1 built an in-depth understanding of educational, workplace, career and retention issues faced by LIS graduates using the life course perspective from the social sciences. This part of the research was sited in North Carolina where a full range of LIS program types exist. One of the programs is in a historically Black institution, allowing a focus on minority career and retention issues. Part 2 used the methods developed in Part 1 to generate a transferable model for career tracking of LIS graduates nationally.  In Part 1, the study developed a comprehensive web-based survey to collect data on the long term career patterns of those who graduated from LIS programs in North Carolina.  The survey collected data on the educational and career histories of respondents, as well as data related to demographics, specific jobs held, breaks in employment, continuing education, opinions about trends in LIS, satisfaction with LIS as a career and perspectives of recent graduates about their LIS programs and entry into the workforce.

Working from one of the widely-used gridded data sets of CO2 emissions, we examine the elements of uncertainty, focusing on gridded data for the U.S. at the scale of 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude.  Uncertainty is introduced in the magnitude of total U.S. emissions, the magnitude and location of large point sources, the magnitude and distribution of non-point sources, and from the use of proxy data to characterize emissions.  For the U.S. we develop estimates of the contribution of each component of uncertainty.  At 1 degree resolution, in most grid cells, the largest contribution to uncertainty comes from how well the distribution of the proxy (in this case population density) represents the distribution of emissions.  In other grid cells the magnitude and location of large point sources make the major contribution to uncertainty.  Uncertainty in population density can be important where a large gradient in population density occurs near a grid cell boundary.  Uncertainty
is strongly scale-dependent with uncertainty increasing as grid size decreases.  Uncertainty for our data set with one degree grid cells for the U.S. is typically on the order of +/- 150%, but this is perhaps not excessive in a data set where emissions per grid cell vary over 8 orders of magnitude.",2016-03-30

Using a critical incidence technique, the survey captured data on a time when health professionals needed health information for patient care, information resources and access points used and impact of the information. The survey invitation was sent via listservs to attending and resident physicians and nurses in the participating hospitals.    Based on estimates provided by the study facilitator at each hospital, the total number of physicians, residents and nurses served by the 56 library sites was approximately 172,463. On that basis, the 16,122  responses represent a response rate of 10%. The response rate for physicians was 10% (n=5,379), for residents 12% (2,123) and for nurses 7% (n=6,788). Response rates by library site varied considerably with 21 sites having a survey response rate of 10% or less, 25 sites had a response rate of 11% to 20% and 10 sites had a response rate of 21% or more.",2012

We assess to what extent social, political, and economic variables are related to the presence of restrictions on the sale of alcohol at the county-level across the United States. Analyzing contemporary county-level data from over 3,000 U.S. counties, the strongest factor associated with “dry” status of a county is the religious composition, specifically the presence of Evangelical Protestants. Conversely, a larger concentration of Roman Catholics inhibits prohibition in a county. The regional character of the political geography of contemporary prohibition—the phenomenon is almost entirely Southern—appears to be driven by the uneven distribution of different religious adherents across the country.",

<br>
<br>
Generally, dyads came to the lab, completed baseline self-report measures, affixed to physiological sensors that measured cardiovascular reactivity (heart rate, blood pressure, pre-ejection period, cardiac output, stroke volume, total peripheral resistance, heart rate variability). Participants remained separated in their private testing rooms and were told they were about to discuss a hypothetical event with their romantic partner. One person was randomly assigned to be the discloser of good news: Experimenters incorporated the participants' answers from the initial questionnaire and indicated to disclosers they had been hypothetically hired for their “dream” job or accepted into their “dream” graduate program. The other members of the romantic dyads—the responders—were informed that their partners received this good news.
<br>
<br>
After role assignment, we implemented a manipulation of the conversation context. In the noncorrespondent condition, couples were told to imagine having to live apart from their partners and endure a long- distance relationship. The news was noncorrespondent for disclosers because the pursuit of their dream job (i.e., self-directed goal) conflicted with their relationship-directed goal. The news was also non- correspondent for responders who would have to endure a long-distance relationship so that their partners could pursue their dream jobs. In the correspondent condition, couples were told to imagine they could live together, with the news being positive for disclosers, responders, and the relationship. Participants were explicitly asked to discuss how this news would make each of them feel and how the news would impact their relationship in the short-term and the long-term. After receiving manipulation instructions, disclosers and responders remained in their private testing rooms for an anticipatory period during which they were given three minutes to “gather their thoughts” to prepare for the conversation. A set of double doors that separated the two private testing rooms was opened to create one, large dyad room when the preparation period ended. Couples then engaged in a conversation for 5-min. After the conversation, participants returned to their private testing rooms for a 3 min recovery period and completed questionnaires. Then, couples reversed roles, such that the discloser in the first conversation was now in the responder role and vice versa. We followed up with couples 3 months after the laboratory session.",

State governments responded quickly to protect public health and stabilize overwhelmed hospital systems. The most restrictive policy, the stay-at-home order, was seen by public health officials as a cornerstone of successful state mitigation strategies. But like many aspects of contemporary politics, support for these efforts took on a distinctly partisan hue. In this paper, I argue that party politics significantly affected state policy responses to COVID-19, which in turn limited mitigation efforts. To this point, I first demonstrate that Democratic governors were faster and more likely to adopt stay-at-home orders than Republicans. Next, using a synthetic control approach, I show that these orders caused residents to practice greater social distancing. Finally, I find that greater social distancing worked to ""flattened the curve"" by limiting the growth of COVID-19 cases. Together these findings show how party politics affected state pandemic responses and have important long-term implications as states begin lifting restrictions.",2020-08-26

Estimating robust cluster standard errors (RCSE) is a common approach to correcting this bias. However, despite their frequent use, recent work indicates that RCSE can also be biased downward. Here I show evidence of that bias and offer a potential solution. Through Monte Carlo simulation of an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model, I compare conventional standard error (OLS-SE) and RCSE performance to that of a bootstrap method that resamples clusters of observations (BCSE). I show that both OLS-SE and RCSE are biased downward, with OLS-SE being the most

This assessment included questions provided by local intervention groups to help focus and monitor prevention programs, and

Researchers interviewed 2,100 individuals at more than 250 of these sites about their risk behaviors, receptivity to HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. The results of this work, as well as in-depth analysis and recommendations for future HIV/AIDS prevention efforts, are presented in this report.

Unfortunately, the interim period between assessments was not sufficient to implement the range of prevention activites anticipated, so the 2003 assessment was essentially a repeat of the 2002 assessments with some additional improvements and objectives.

A characteristic was chosen for the masculinity scale if it was judged to be significantly more desirable for a man than for a woman. Femininity items were similarly chosen and androgyny items were those judged by both male and female judges to be equally (not significantly different) desirable for males and females. 20 items of each type were included in the scale. Rs are asked to indicate on a 7 point scale how well each of the 60 characteristics describes themselves. Each R receives three scores: masculinity, femininity, and androgyny.

It should be stated that the implemented procedure of cutting the sample size guarantees that the smaller sample is still representative at the national level.

</p>   <b>Household Data</b> <p>For the household interview, a single member of the household was asked questions that pertained to the entire family. The respondent was usually the oldest living woman in the home since she was available to be interviewed during the daytime. Any attempt to identify one person as the ""household head"" is as problematic in Russia as it is in the United States. Thus, the interviewer was instructed to speak with ""the person who knows the most about this family's shop
ping and health.""</p>  <b>Individual Data</b> <p>In theory, the individual questionnaire is administered to every person living in the household. In practice, however, some individuals, such as very young children and elderly people, did not receive an individual interview. Individual-level information is the primary source of information pertaining to a person's health, employment status, demographic characteristics, and anthropometry. It can also be used to supplement household-level income an
d expenditure information.</p>  <p>To safeguard the confidentiality of RLMS respondents, individual-level data sets omit text variables (designated char on questionnaires).

The SCL-90R provides measures of psychological distress across the following 9 subscales: Somatization, Obsessive-Compulsive, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Depression, Anxiety, Hostility, Phobic Anxiety, Paranoid Ideation, and Psychoticism. It also yields 3 Global Indices: the Global Severity Index (GSI), the Positive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI), and Positive Symptom Total (PST). This instrument has demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha for subscales ranging from .77 to .90) and test-retest reliability, which ranged from .78 to .90. The SCL-90R has been widely used in research with numerous pain conditions, including TMD.",

The scale contains statements about certain situations, six good events and six bad events. As well, half of the items deal with affiliation while the other half are concerned with achievement. Respondents provide the major cause and answer questions concerning the event which reveal internal/external, stable/unstable, global/specific attributions for the cause. Individuals w
ho give internal, stable and global causes for uncontrollable bad events are said to display learned helplessness, a possible risk factor in subsequent depression.
</p><p>Peterson et al.(1982) describe the scaling of the attributional styles questionnaire as follows: The three attributional dimension rating scales associated with each event description are scored in the directions of increasing internality, stability, and globality. Composite scores are created by simply summing the appropriate items and dividing the sum by the number of items in the composite.</p><p>The composite scoring procedure has the effect of according each item equal status, since
they tended to have comparable means and standard deviations. However, other researchers are cautioned against summing items when they are greatly discrepant with regard to means and/or standard deviations, since this unweighted procedure would give some items more weight than others in the composite. In the case of such discrepancies, it is recommended that the items be normalized (i.e., subtract the item mean for the sample from the item score and divide by the item standard deviation for the sample.)
</p><p>The construction of the scale allows for the derivation of 20 different subscales based on different composites of items. At the finest level of analysis, one can derive 12 subscales based on three items each (e.g. rated stability of the attributions for the three good-outcome achievement-related events). Collapsing across the achievement-affiliation distinction, one can obtain six subscales based on six items each (e.g. rated stability of the attributions for the six good-outcome events)
. Finally, one can combine the internality, stability, and globality scales into two composite attributional style scores, one for good and one for bad events, based on 18 items each.

Differences: The Chronic Saline is a valid treatment for the PUP DAM dam but not the TARGET. Also: The vocalization data is summarized differently.  This experiment collected ultra-sonic vocalization (USV) or “call” data from rat pups in a preference-experiment set-up.  The experiment was conducted on three days:  Pup post-natal day (PND) 2 and Target Dam post-partum day (PPD) 1; pup PND 4 and Dam PPD 3; and pup PND 6 and Dam PPD 5.    The Target Dams were from either of three groups (CC, CS, and UN).  The pups were from two groups (CC and UN).    The Preference experiment (data in CPU_xx) was conducted with a standard two-lane choice apparatus.  The Baseline measurements were taken with the Target Dam in the chamber WITHOUT any pups, and observing it.  Measurements at Post-Partum Days 1, 3, and 5 were taken of the Target Dam with a pup in either side lane.  Lanes of the CC and UN pups were switched during each day.  For example, if the CC pup was placed in the left lane in PPD 1, it would be placed in the RIGHT lane in PPD3, and back to the LEFT lane in PPD 5.  These technical terms were used: 	Frequency: Number of times the behavior happened 	Duration: In seconds. How long the behavior continued 	Latency: How many seconds into test that behavior started  Each observation period lasted two minutes (about 120 seconds).  The pup was put into one of the sides of the box, and its USV cries were recorded for 60 seconds.  At this point, the Target Dam was introduced into the chamber and allowed to choose one side or the other.  Recording of the pup’s cries continued during this second 60-second period.

Part 1 built an in-depth understanding of educational, workplace, career and retention issues faced by LIS graduates using the life course perspective from the social sciences. This part of the research was sited in North Carolina where a full range of LIS program types exist. One of the programs is in a historically Black institution, allowing a focus on minority career and retention issues. Part 2 used the methods developed in Part 1 to generate a transferable model for career tracking of LIS graduates nationally.  In Part 1, the study developed a comprehensive web-based survey to collect data on the long term career patterns of those who graduated from LIS programs in North Carolina.  The survey collected data on the educational and career histories of respondents, as well as data related to demographics, specific jobs held, breaks in employment, continuing education, opinions about trends in LIS, satisfaction with LIS as a career and perspectives of recent graduates about their LIS programs and entry into the workforce. Respondents were asked to identify up to five specific jobs in terms of the following categories: job immediately before the
ir LIS program, job immediately after their LIS program, current job or last job depending on employment status, longest job and highest-achieving job. The response rate for the WILIS 1 study was 35% (n=2660).",2012

In most cases, these spreadsheet files offer the user direct access to more data than are shown either in the publication or Adobe Acrobat. These files usually contain more years of data, more geographic areas, and/or more categories of subjects than those shown in the Acrobat version. The extensive selection of statistics is provided for the United States, with selected data for regions, divisions, states, metropolitan areas, cities, and foreign countries from reports and records of government and private agencies.

Additional information for states, cities, counties, metropolitan areas, and other small units, as well as more historical data are available in various supplements to the Abstract. Statistics in this edition are generally for the most recent year or period available by summer 2006.

We argue that this process is influenced by the political context and particularly by institutional rules that serve to reinforce and reactivate divisions among justices, leading to less cooperation on the court. We test our theory with original data comprising all education cases decided from 1995 to 2005 in all fifty states and find evidence to support our theory. Specifically, we find that elections lead to fewer unanimous decisions and more separate written opinions, indicating that judicial elections may have a more pervasive effect on the daily work of these courts than previously thought.",

Traditionally, safety and injury analysis has occurred in siloed fields, with road safety researchers relying predominately on police-recorded crash reports, and public health researchers relying on hospitalization records. Depending on the context of the study and the database used, findings vary. This is the case for the micro-level (e.g., injury severity of an individual) to the macro-level (e.g., injury rate) scale.

This project begins to map disparate data sets to inform questions surrounding crashes. The data-mapping process will aim to build linkages between police-crash datasets and other datasets (i.e., incident-oriented data, spatial data, emerging datasets) and scale it up to larger geographic areas. Efforts to augment crash data are not new. A notable health-oriented example which sought to link health and police records was the Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System (CODES). Although this federal program ended in 2013, some states, including California, North Carolina, and Tennessee, have continued this effort.

Added data and analytics resulted in a more “complete picture” of crashes and injuries. This complete picture enables researchers to improve their modeling, assist policy makers, and contribute to visualization that helps tell compelling safety stories that guide safety improvements.

At the end of the intake session they were given instructions about the experience sampling procedure. Each couple started the experience sampling on the Saturday following the intake session. For eight days (two Saturdays, two Sundays, one Monday, one Tuesday, one Thursday and one Friday), participants received six signals per day, approximately one signal every two hours, to ask them some questions (many of them regarding sacrifices – see also variables list)
<br><br>
Furthermore, each day, after 9.00 pm. participants performed a daily diary survey with general questions about their day.
<br><br>
Finally, one year later, couples were contacted again for a follow-up in which they replied to few questions.

Using Mooney’s (2012) collective action problem theoretical framework on legislative leadership power, I claim that legislative term limits should be a key determinant in a state Speaker’s power via the delegation of institutional tools that control the lawmaking process. Speakers can use these tools to influence policy outcomes and their colleagues. I test this expectation in an analysis of lower chamber rules in nearly all states between 1981 and 2015. The results indicate that states with implemented term limits are associated with a more powerful Speaker.

This part of the research was sited in North Carolina where a full range of LIS program types exist. One of the programs is in a historically Black institution, allowing a focus on minority career and retention issues. Part 2 used the methods developed in Part 1 to generate a transferable model for career tracking of LIS graduates nationally.  In Part 1, the study developed a comprehensive web-based survey to collect data on the long term career patterns of those who graduated from LIS programs in North Carolina.  The survey collected data on the educational and career histories of respondents, as well as data related to demographics, specific jobs held, breaks in employment, continuing education, opinions about trends in LIS, satisfaction with LIS as a career and perspectives of recent graduates about their LIS programs and entry into the workforce. Respondents were asked to identify up to five specific jobs in terms of the following categories: job immediately before their LIS program, job immediately after their LIS program, current job or last job depending on employment status, longest job and highest-achieving job.

The information is coded in a series of Access 2007 database files. We have also posted a preliminary codebook. This version will be updated as the databases are updated.

A number of comments need to be made with regards to the database files. Be sure to read this information before using the data.

1. Access files automatically save all changes made to them upon entry of new information/edits. As such, it is extremely important that anyone who downloads these files is very careful about editing.

2. These files continue to be revised and cleaned as we work with them. As such, we will be sure to indicate the date of posting. Please be sure to check back with our postings when working with the data to be sure that you are working with the most current version. We of course greatly appreciate being told if errors are found that we can verify and correct. Our goal is to have as clean a dataset as possible.

3. Working with Access may be unfamiliar to some, but it is a powerful and relatively easy way to assemble working datasets that can be imported into Stata or any other statistical program one wishes to employ. The database consists of a series of tables in which information is entered. These tables are linked through references based upon common variables. For example, the case number is entered into the general case characteristics table and that case number is the reference variable for the legal issues table. Access provides a powerful tool, the query function to build datasets consisting of data from the various tables. We recommend that you use this function for constructing datasets consisting of whatever subset of the data you wish.

4. While we have posted the full databases, we do not have equal confidence in all of the coded information. In the codebook we discuss in detail issues we encountered in collecting the information. One variable merits mention here. At this point, we do not have confidence in the issue area data we collected. The choice of terms from the ECJ case books, it turns out, is not based upon a well-defined coding scheme from the Court. We have correspondence from the Court to this effect.

Here we show that three classic psycholinguistic effects can in fact be replicated using AMT in combination with open-source software for gathering response times client-side. Specially, we find reliable effects of subject definiteness, filler-gap dependency processing, and agreement attraction in self-paced reading tasks using approximately the same numbers of participants and/or trials as similar laboratory studies.

In a largely separate vein of research, the field experiment—with many applications in state legislatures—has emerged as an important approach in establishing causal identification in the study of legislative politics. The stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA)—the assumption that a unit’s outcome is unaffected by other units’ treatment statuses— is required in conventional approaches to causal inference with experiments. When SUTVA is violated via networked social interaction, treatment effects spread to con- trol units through the network structure. We review recently developed methods that can be used to account for interference in the analysis of data from field experi- ments on state legislatures. The methods we review require the researcher to specify a spillover model, according to which legislators influence each other, and specify the network through which spillover occurs. We discuss these and other specification steps in detail. We find moderate evidence for spillover effects in data from two previ- ously published field experiments. Our replication analyses illustrate how researchers can use recently developed methods to test for interference effects, and support the case for considering interference effects in experiments on state legislatures.",2019-06-10

<p><p>
BACKGROUND
Tobacco, alcohol, and sugar consumption contribute to cancer burden. An evidence-based population-level intervention to reduce intake of tobacco, alcohol, and sugar-added products is the implementation of policies that increase their price. This can be done through excise taxes, mitigation fees, bans on discounts, and minimum prices. Yet, the adoption of these evidence-based policies has received only limited traction, and public support is undermined by industry-led efforts to oppose policy interventions. This proposal is guided by a working hypothesis that public acceptance of different tax and non-tax pricing interventions for cancer risk behaviors varies by: (a) policy type, (b) the way the message is framed, and (c) the cancer-causing product it addresses.
<p>
AIMS
We examine this working hypothesis through specific aims to: (1) identify and optimize ways to communicate price policy options for cancer-causing products to the public and (2) explore the effects of policy type, frames, and behavioural domain on public policy support.
<p>
PARTICIPANTS
Participants in the interview stage (qualitative) will be: 6 members of the public, 6 cancer survivors, and 6 cancer policy advocates – half of each stakeholder group will be in each country. Participants in the quantitative study will be solicited by Qualtrics's Survey Panels service (n=1800).
<p>
METHODS
This project will use a mixed-methods approach to understand the framing of tax and non- tax pricing policy interventions to reduce consumption of cancer-causing products. We will conduct formative qualitative research with stakeholders, identify frames to test, and pilot the frames in a quantitative study. We will then implement a 3x3x4 factorial experiment to assess the impact of the frames, cancer-causing products discussed, and pricing policy options on support for policies among UK and US adults.",2019-04-12

However, legislators wield substantially greater power in the lawmaking process when they hold leadership positions. Incorporation of these groups into leadership positions could indicate fuller political representation, but scholars to date have not assessed how well these groups are represented in leadership. We analyze original data describing the backgrounds of approximately 2,200 leaders in 30 states between 2003 and 2014. The data show that, on average across states, members of these groups are as well represented in state legislative leadership positions as they are in rank-and-file membership, but there is substantial variation across states and across parties. We then ask what factors might explain this variation and explore institutional characteristics, like the number of leadership positions or leader selection methods. The results show that legislative chambers with a higher number of leadership posts tend to have more women in leadership, and that selection through elections is associated with decreased African American presence in leadership. The findings have implications for minority incorporation and influence in American politics.",

People take cues from elites and as a result, alter their preferences based on those elite cues. In particular, self-identified Republicans and conservatives are more suspicious of scientists and academics, and more likely to dismiss or disbelieve scientific findings. We apply these findings in the context of attitudes about concussion-related injuries in sports. We theorize that groups predisposed against academics and scientists will be less likely to believe in connections between head injuries and organized sports. Using a nationally representative survey conducted in 2016, we find strong support for our theory. There is widespread of acceptance of that concussions and head injuries are a problem in sports with 65% saying they are a major problem and 29% saying minor problem. Attitudes about the dangers of brain injuries and acceptance of new scientific findings are divided by party identification, especially among those with the highest levels of political knowledge. Further, attitudes about new science on concussions are related to attitudes about climate change.

Many, if not most of these migrants, who are generally possessed of low human and financial capital on arrival in the city, will settle in slums, the areas of concentrated poverty and environmental vulnerability that are already a dominant feature of much of the urban landscape of the developing world. Bangladesh will be no exception to these trends. The growth in her urban population is set to outstrip by a wide margin that in rural areas. Moreover, the urban growth already experienced in recent decades demonstrates that slums will likely be an increasingly important feature of urban existence in Bangladesh. Anticipating these developments, USAID and the Government of Bangladesh tasked a research team based in Bangladesh and the United States (at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) with conducting a survey designed to obtain a broad health profile of the urban population of Bangladesh.

Descriptive and analytical statistical methods were applied. The results showed that the major challenges and constraints faced by fish farmers were high cost of feed, weak co-operative, low price offered by traders, lack of technical knowledge and extension services, and limited access to credits.

Therefore, the study recommended strategies that can lead to an improvement in the income of farmers including strengthening the existing fish farmer’s cooperative in order to organize the farmers, purchasing inputs by bulk, marketing as a group, and providing fish farmers with training in conjunction with the National Center for Agricultural Research and Extension (NCARE) specialists.

Fewer than four percent of these respondents graduated prior to 2003. Programs with multiple degrees were able to select the degree programs included in their sample. The graduates received an email invitation and three email reminders.  A few programs mailed paper invitations to encourage better response rates.   The response rate for the survey was 41% (n=3507).

Such multicollinearity (“MC”) makes it difficult to identify the independent effect that each of these variables has on the outcome of interest. In an effort to circumvent MC, researchers sometimes drop collinear variables from the regression model. Using simulated data, we demonstrate the implications that MC has for statistical estimation and the potential for introducing bias that the omitting-variables approach generates. We also discuss MC in the context of multiplicative interaction models, using research on the influence of the initiative on policy responsiveness as an applied example. We conclude with advice for researchers faced with MC in their datasets.",

<p>
To be eligible, they must have been at least 18 years old, fluent in English, and in their relationship for at least 2 months.
<p>
On average, participants were 22 years old (range 18-56), had been involved in their romantic relationship for an average length of 21 months (range 1-87), 43% were Asian/Asian American or Pacific Islander, 36% were European or European American, and 9% were Hispanic (13% other race/ethnicities). 71 out of the 72 couples were heterosexual.
<p>
Participants independently completed an online questionnaire in the days prior to their lab session. The couple attended the lab session together. There, the participants participated in a series of structured videorecorded conversations, and privately answered brief questionnaires at the beginning of the lab session and again after each conversation. Topics were: <p>
-A teamwork task: For this task, couples were given 4 min to work together ranking items needed for survival if they were stranded in the Far North (Winter Survival
Exercise; Johnson & Johnson, 2003). <p>
- A problem solving discussion:  For this conversation, both partners listed the top three sources of conflict in their relationship at the beginning of the session and later one partner was randomly assigned to pick the topic for the conversation from one of the three that they had listed. The partner who selected the topic was put in charge of the conversation and couples were given 5 min to work toward a resolution of the conflict. 
<p>
After each conversation, participants completed a series of questions regarding their emotions, relationship quality, sense of power, and perspective taking (See attached excel file for variables).
<p>
After the conversations, participants also separately completed a perspective taking task designed to assess how well they were able to take their partner's perspective on a variety of different topics.
<p>
Six months after the completion of the lab study, both partners separately completed a longitudinal follow-up survey with questions about their relationships.

29291,https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/D9ZUIB,,"While most Americans appear to acknowledge the large gap between the rich and the poor in the U.S., it is not clear if the public is aware of recent changes in income inequality. Even though economic inequality has grown substantially in recent decades, studies have shown that the public's perception of growing income disparities has remained mostly unchanged since the 1980s. This research offers an alternative approach to evaluating how public perceptions of inequality are developed. Centrally, it conceptualizes the public's response to growing economic disparities by applying theories of macro-political behavior and place-based contextual effects to the formation of aggregate perceptions about income inequality. It is argued that most of the public relies on basic information about the economy to form attitudes about inequality and that geographic context---in this case, the American states---plays a role in how views of income disparities are produced. A new measure of state perceptions of growing economic inequality over a 25-year period is used to examine whether the public is responsive to objective changes in economic inequality. Time-series cross-sectional analyses suggest that the public's perceptions of growing inequality are largely influenced by objective state economic indicators and state political ideology. This research has implications for how knowledgeable the public is of disparities between the rich and the poor, whether state context influences attitudes about inequality, and what role the public will have in determining how expanding income differences are addressed through government policy.",2017-02-10

Both supporters and opponents of the requirement argue that its effect fades away because states circumvent it in various ways, especially by raising fees that are not subject to the requirement. Existing literature, however, offers little and inconsistent evidence on whether the effect decays over time and whether the decay results from fee hikes. This paper documents legal cases to show the ways in which states have responded to the requirement, estimates whether the effects of the requirement decay over time, and tests if states raise fees instead of taxes after adopting such a requirement. Using state-level panel data, I find that the initial effectiveness of the requirement on tax burden does decay approximately a decade after enactment and that the decay is not the result of fee increases.",2018-03-24

The term is borrowed from axiology, to designate an interest that is held because it serves other, more ultimate interests. Extrinsic values are always instrumental and utilitarian. Persons
with this orientation may find religion useful in a variety of ways, to provide security and solace, sociability and distraction, status and self-justification. The embraced creed is lightly held or else selectively shaped to fit more primary needs. In theological terms the extrinsic type turns to God, but without turning away from self.
</p><p>Intrinsic Orientation -- Persons with this orientation find their master motive in religion. Other needs, strong as they may be, are regarded as of less ultimate significance, and they are, so far as possible, brought into harmony with the religious beliefs and prescriptions. Having embraced a creed the individual endeavors to internalize it and follow it fully. It is in this sense that he lives his religion.</p><p>The scale consists of 11 extrinsic and 9 intrinsic items.

We hypothesized that participants would support redistribution more when they felt low in subjective status than when they felt high, even when actual resources and self-interest were held constant. Moreover, we predicted that people would legitimize these shifts in policy attitudes by appealing selectively to ideological principles concerning fairness. In four studies we found correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Studies 2 - 4) evidence that subjective status motivates shifts in support for redistributive policies along with the ideological principles that justify them.",2014-09-09

This 2014 modeling platform includes all criteria air pollutants and precursors (CAPs), two groups of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and diesel particulate matter. The first group of HAPs are those explicitly used by the chemical mechanism in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for ozone/particulate matter (PM): chlorine (Cl), hydrogen chloride (HCl), benzene, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, methanol, naphthalene. The second group consists of 51 HAPs or HAP groups (such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon groups) added to CMAQ for the purposes of air quality modeling for the 2014 National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA). The latter five HAPs in the first group are also abbreviated as NBAFM in subsequent sections of the document. A list of all HAPs and diesel species in this modeling platform is in Appendix A. This platform is called the “2014 NATA-Based Platform, version 7.1” (2014v7.1) because it is a HAP-CAP used primarily for NATA. Here, “version 7.1” denotes an evolution from the earlier versions of the 2014-based platform. Version 7.0 supported the initial modeling for NATA. A version subsequent to that supported a CAP application of the 2014 NEI. Both platforms were the starting point for a number of the ancillary (non-emissions) data files for version 7.1.

<p>The 2014v7.1 platform was used to support the 2014 NATA, the focus of which is multipollutant modeling of HAPs and CAPs using CMAQ version 5.2 multipollutant. The CMAQ modeling domain includes the lower 48 states and parts of Canada and Mexico. The 2014 NATA also utilizes the American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD), which is an air dispersion modeling system, for all NEI HAPs (about 130 more than covered by CMAQ) across all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Emissions preparation for AERMOD is discussed elsewhere.</p>

Part 1 built an in-depth understanding of educational, workplace, career and retention issues faced by LIS graduates using the life course perspective from the social sciences. This part of the research was sited in North Carolina where a full range of LIS program types exist. One of the programs is in a historically Black institution, allowing a focus on minority career and retention issues. Part 2 used the methods developed in Part 1 to generate a transferable model for career tracking of LIS graduates nationally.  In Part 1, the study developed a comprehensive web-based survey to collect data on the long term career patterns of those who graduated from LIS programs in North Carolina.  The survey collected data on the educational and career histories of respondents, as well as data related to demographics, specific jobs held, breaks in employment, continuing education, opinions about trends in LIS, satisfaction with LIS as a career and perspectives of recent graduates about their LIS programs and entry into the workforce. Respondents were asked to identify up to five specific jobs in terms of the following categories: job immediately before their LIS program, job immediately after their LIS program, current job or last job depending on employment status, longest job and highest-achieving job. The response rate for the WILIS 1 study was 35% (n=2660).",2012

In this study, I examine how this combination of functions affects the regulatory style embraced by these agencies. I find, through interviews with environmental agency workers and empirical analyses using enforcement data from 2010-2014, that the cooperation and flexibility with industry inherent to natural resource conservation efforts is a fundamental part of the regulatory process within these combined agencies. Great efforts are made to garner voluntary or negotiated compliance without the possible economic consequences of punitive actions. Enforcements are less frequent and less severe. The effect of this agency design choice is powerful, maintaining its effect even when controlling for political, ideological, and economical pressures. In a time where environmental protection agencies are increasingly interested in incorporating management-based regulation and voluntary compliance to supplement command and control regulation, it is more important than ever to understand the regulation that emerges from this combination.",

The barangays, which contained about 28,000 households, were completely surveyed in late 1982 and again in early 1983 to locate all pregnant women. Women of the selected barangays who gave birth between May 1, 1983, and April 30, 1984, are included in the sample. A baseline interview was conducted among 3,327 women during the 6th to 7th month of pregnancy so that all births, including preterm births, could be identified. Subsequent surveys took place immediately after birth, then at bimonthly intervals for 24 months. From the baseline sample, there were 3,080 nontwin live births. Approximately 2,600 households were studied intensively for the full 2 years. Each survey collects detailed health, nutrition, demographic, and socioeconomic data.

Because there is an indication that men may sexually abuse adolescent girls in their homes and because it was believed that some adolescent girls may not frequent public places, a household survey was added to the PLACE method.

I examine how courts condition the relationship between state-level public opinion and policy. The system of federalism in the United States allows federal and state courts to establish the types of policies that states are constitutionally allowed to implement. In particular, federal courts can set ""federal floors"" for policy, below which no states can go. State courts, in
turn, can raise the level of this floor. Thus, both federal and state courts shape whether state policy can match the preferences of the median voter in a given state. Analyzing data on public opinion, judicial decisions, and state-level policy on the issue of abortion, from 1973 to 2012, I show that changes in the set of allowable abortion restrictions, according to the combined decisions of state and federal courts, significantly affect whether states implement majority-preferred policies. I also show that ignoring the influence of courts on the policy-making environment significantly affects the estimated level of policy congruence, and thus conclusions about the
scope of representation. These results demonstrate the importance of placing courts in the larger study of state-level representation.",2017-07-26

The government family planning service providers in the 21 districts were trained on (a) the delivery of LAPM, (b) counseling on LAPM, and (c) LAPM client management. The effect of the project was assessed in a “before-after and intervention-comparison” comparative framework. The baseline and endline data were compared between six randomly selected intervention districts and three comparison districts. The data on LAPM use were collected from 5,864 randomly selected currently married women of reproductive age during February-May 2013 both from the intervention and comparison districts. These data were compared with those obtained through the 2010 Bangladesh Maternal Mortality Survey, which was conducted during January-August 2010 in the six intervention and three comparison districts.  Additionally, in 2013, data on provider skills and practices were collected from 627 government family planning workers from the six intervention districts and three comparison districts.

The study builds on previous research notably that of the “Rochester study” conducted in the early 1990s by Marshall and a study team from the Rochester, NY area. The planning group spent considerable time considering changes in the health sciences information environment since the Rochester study was conducted. This study updates the Rochester design and methods. The study employed multiple methods, both quantitative and qualitative. The Value Study used a multi-stage research design with a pilot phase involving 7 library sites. The full study included 56 library sites serving 118 hospitals.   Using a critical incidence technique, the survey captured data on a time when health professionals needed health information for patient care, information resources and access points used and impact of the information. The survey invitation was sent via listservs to attending and resident physicians and nurses in the participating hospitals.

A major challenge in evaluating policy representation is the measurement of state-level public opinion and public policy.  Though recent studies of policy responsiveness and congruence have provided improved measures of public opinion using multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) techniques, these analyses are limited by their static nature and cross-sectional design.  Issue attitudes, unlike more general political orientations, often vary considerably over time.  Unless the dynamics of issue-specific public opinion are appropriately incorporated into the analyses, tests of policy responsiveness and congruence may be misleading.  Thus, we assess the degree of policy representation in direct democracy states regarding same-sex relationship recognition policies using dynamic models of policy adoption and congruence that employ dynamic MRP estimates of attitudes toward same-sex marriage.  We find that direct democracy institutions increase policy responsiveness as well as congruence with issue-specific public opinion.",

In the present study, an effectiveness of music therapy on the quality of sleep in cancer patients was evaluated. 184 adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy were selected from the population who met the inclusion criteria based on convenience sampling. They were randomly assigned to three groups: two intervention groups of active or receptive music therapy and a control group. Participants completed Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at pre-intervention and post-intervention stages. Ten sessions of active or receptive music therapy were applied to the intervention groups, while the control group received only routine medical care. Every session was of 20-30 minutes. Receptive music therapy involved patient’s preferred Persian pop music, and active music therapy involved playing guitar and singing under training and supervision of a music-therapist. Two-way Analysis of Covariance indicated significant differences between results of pre-test and post-test on sleep quality in both intervention groups. It showed the effectiveness of music therapy in experimental groups, as compared to the control group, and revealed active music therapy to be more effective to improve sleep quality.

<h3>CMAQv5.3.1 Inputs</h3>
CMAQv5.3.1 comes with new input and output benchmark data for July 2016 over the Southeast US. The input datasets are identical to those released with v5.3 but additional files are now included in the .tar.gz files that will allow users to test the WRFv4.1.1-CMAQv5.3 coupled model on the Southeast benchmark domain. As a result, there is no need for users who have already downloaded the v5.3 Southeast benchmark input data to download the v5.3.1 files unless they are planning to run the coupled model. The Southeast benchmark output data for v5.3.1 is slightly different from what was released with v5.3 as described in the <a href=""https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ/blob/master/DOCS/Release_Notes/CMAQ_FAQ.md"">CMAQv5.3.1 Release Notes FAQ. </a>

<h3>CMAQv5.3.2 Inputs</h3>
CMAQv5.3.2 comes with new input and output benchmark data for 2 days, July 1-2, 2016, over the Southeast US. The input datasets for these two days are identical to those released with v5.3.1 except for the addition of a grid mask file for the United States: <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/16JJ4d6ChBJsvMc_ErqwDBrFfGh2MnVYR/view?usp=sharing"">GRIDMASK_STATES_12SE1.nc</a>.

First, membership retention on committees is generally lower, even after accounting for differing levels of legislative turnover across legislatures. Second, many state legislative committee systems undergo reorganization between sessions, changing the policy jurisdictions, and therefore the applicability of members’ previously developed expertise. In this paper, I examine the consequences of these two sources of committee instability on legislative output in fourteen state legislatures. I find that both membership retention and jurisdictional reorganization significantly affect the number of bills processed through committees and the number of bills ultimately enacted. These linkages are also conditioned on several committee and institutional factors, particularly legislative turnover.

<p>The emissions modeling platform uses SMOKE v4.7 to apportion the emissions inventories into the grid cells used by CMAQ and temporalizes the emissions into hourly values. In addition, the pollutants in the inventories (e.g., NOx, PM and VOC) are split into the chemical species needed by CMAQ.  For the purposes of preparing the CMAQ- ready emissions, the NEI emissions inventories by data category are split into emissions modeling platform “sectors”; and emissions from sources other than the NEI are added, such as the Canadian, Mexican, and offshore inventories. Emissions within the emissions modeling platform are separated into sectors for groups of related emissions source categories that are run through all of the SMOKE programs, except the final merge, independently from emissions categories in the other sectors.  
(See pre-merged sector files below.)</p>

<br>
<p>
The final merge program called Mrggrid combines low-level sector-specific gridded, speciated and temporalized emissions to create the final CMAQ-ready emissions inputs. For biogenic emissions, the CMAQ model allows for biogenic emissions to be included in the CMAQ-ready emissions inputs, or for biogenic emissions to be computed within CMAQ itself (the “inline” option).  (See merged 2D files below)
</p>
<br>
<p>This study uses the inline biogenic emissions option. Table 3-1 from the following report https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-11/documents/2017_emissionschapter.pdf presents the sectors in the emissions modeling platform used to develop the year 2017 emissions for this project. 
</p>
<p>
The emissions inventories created for input to SMOKE, are based on the April, 2020 version of the 2017 NEI. The NEI includes five main data categories: a) nonpoint (formerly called “stationary area”) sources; b) point sources; c) nonroad mobile sources; d) onroad mobile sources; and e) fires. For CAPs, the NEI data are largely compiled from data submitted by state, local and tribal (S/L/T) agencies.  HAP emissions data are often augmented by EPA when they are not voluntarily submitted to the NEI by S/L/T agencies.  The NEI was compiled using the Emissions Inventory System (EIS).  EIS includes hundreds of automated QA checks to improve data quality, and it also supports release point (stack) coordinates separately from facility coordinates.  EPA collaboration with S/L/T agencies helped prevent duplication between point and nonpoint source categories such as industrial boilers.  
</p>
<p>
The 2017 NEI Technical Support Document describes in detail the development of the 2017 emission inventories and is available at https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/2017-national-emissions-inventory-nei-technical-support-document-tsd (EPA, 2020a). Point source data from the 2017 NEI, including data submitted to EIS by S/L/T agencies, were used for this study. EPA used the SMARTFIRE2 system and the BlueSky emissions modeling framework to develop year 2017 fire emissions.  SMARTFIRE2 categorizes all fires as either prescribed burning or wildfire categories, and the Bluesky framework includes emission factor estimates for both types of fires.  Onroad and nonroad mobile source emissions for year 2017 were developed by running MOVES2014b (https://www.epa.gov/moves).  Canadian emissions interpolated to the year 2017 from 2015 and 2023 were used, and Mexican emissions were for the year 2016.  
</p>

<p>
The 2017 Emission Modeling Platform is primarily based on the 2017gb emissions case prepared by EPA, but there are differences between this package and the EPA emissions case:
</p>
<p>
- This package includes a newer airports inventory from 2017 NEI than was used in the 
  original 2017gb emissions case. This newer version, which was not available until after the 2017gb emissions case was completed in May 2020, corrects an overestimation of emissions from airports.
- This package includes average speed distributions (SPDIST) from 2017. The original 2017gb emissions case used average speed distributions from 2016. This is an input to SMOKE-MOVES and affects the ""RPD"" category of onroad emissions.

Scale refinement yielded has yielded a logically valid and reliable measure with a high internal consistency. Repeated measurements indicated a high degree of scale stability reinforcing the conception of self-motivation as relatively enduring and trait-like. Convergent evidence for construct val

Discriminant validity was evidenced by minimal overlap with motivational measures of social desirability, health locus of control, and achievement tendency; in each case, less than 10% of the variance in self-motivation was explained. Predictive validity was demonstrated in a variety of naturalistic settings in which perseverant behavior was easily quantified. These included habitual exercise programs for exercise training, preventive medicine, and acute exercise. The diversity of these settings supported the situational invariance of self-motivation. Collectively, these findings provide considerable support for the valid and reliable assessment of self-motivation and for its distinctive utility in enhancing the prediction of perseverant behavior, specifically, adherence to therapeutic exercise.""

The first area is in the domain of surveys and app analytics: developers of mobile applications (apps) in both academic and commercial environments require information about their users, as well as how the apps are being used, to understand who their users are and how to optimally approach application development. The second area of need is in the field of ecological momentary assessment, also referred to as experience sampling: researchers in a wide variety of fields, spanning from the social sciences to psychology to clinical medicine, would like to be able to capture daily or even more frequent data from research subjects while in their natural environment. Survalytics is an open-source solution for the collection of survey responses as well as arbitrary analytic metadata from users of Android OS applications. Surveys may be administered in any combination of one-time questions and ongoing questions. The module may be deployed as a standalone app for experience sampling purposes or as an add-on to existing apps.  The module takes advantage of free-tier NoSQL cloud database management offered by the Amazon Web Services DynamoDB platform to package a secure, flexible, extensible data collection module. DynamoDB is capable of HIPAA-compliant storage of personal health information.

Emerging data clearly correlates poor dental and oral health with systemic medical comorbidity and associated mortality.  Dental diseases have been correlated with numerous inflammatory and infectious diseases.  Poor oral health may directly lead to bacterial colonization which may facilitate bacteremia and chronic inflammation of multiple organ systems.  Furthermore, poor oral health frequently contributes to avoidable hospital admissions thereby adding to public and private healthcare expenditures. Persons with MI are at higher risk of dental disease related morbidity due to multiple reasons which include poor insight, lower interest or motivation, financial challenges, side effects of psychotropic medications and comorbid substance use along with barriers related to knowledge, attitudes and access to dental health care system.  Poor oral health status (OHS), in part, with other high rates of systemic illnesses among patients with MI is associated with 25 years lower life expectancy than the general population. In this research, we examined OHS of patients with MI and investigated associated underlying reasons in terms of perceptions, beliefs and practices among persons with MI, psychiatrists and dentists.  Establishing the current state of awareness, challenges and practices towards oral health in this vulnerable population may help in designing much needed interventions to improve dental, psychiatric and other systemic morbidity outcomes.",2019-10-05

These mechanisms are tested using data on incentive spending and inequality across the fifty states from 1999-2014. The findings demonstrate that incentives increase income inequality by reducing redistribution over the long run.

The Archive of Haitian Religion and Culture: Collaborative Research and Scholarship on Haiti and the Haitian Diaspora grant, led by project director Benjamin Hebblethwaite (UF) and co-director Laurent Dubois (Duke) will improve the understanding of a central Haitian and Haitian-American spiritual tradition, the Vodou religion, by gathering the audiovisual and textual sources of communities, by interpreting the collected materials, by expanding the holdings through a self-submission tool, and by diffusing the knowledge via an open access digital library hosted within the existing Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC; www.dloc.com). The Archive of Haitian Religion and Culture: Collaborative Research and Scholarship on Haiti and the Haitian Diaspora project is part of a tradition of scholarly work stretching back to the early 20th century that has sought to counter reductionist and racist visions of Vodou religion through ethnography, analysis of culture and music, and an exploration of the role of religion in Haiti’s founding revolution (1791-1803). Such work has long turned to the central texts of worship which are Haitian Creole language songs. This three-year project will create a freely accessible multimedia digital library that uses audiovisual technologies to curate, elucidate and facilitate the advanced search of the rich primary materials of a central Haitian and Haitian-American spiritual tradition in order to promote discovery and educate a broad public.

Using lobbying records for all electric utilities in the United States from 1998 to 2012, we examine how state policies affect federal lobbying by both proponents and opponents of federal support for the renewable energy policy. Our theory predicts that supportive state policies reduce the returns to lobbying by both proponents and opponents. Empirically, we show that when the federal production tax credit for renewable energy is about to expire, electric utilities from states without renewable portfolio standards become more likely to lobby than those from states with these policies. Because the timing of the expiration of the production tax credit is quasi-random, these findings carry a causal interpretation. Using text analysis techniques, we also show that the lobbying efforts are focused on energy and environmental issues while lobbying on unrelated topics remains unaffected.",

Used to empower program managers to evaluate program performance, the LQAS method enables these managers to assess whether program objectives and targets have been achieved within a specific unit of interest (a geographical area, a facility, an organization, or any other catchment area). The LQAS data collection method provides a viable alternative to traditional surveys. The method allows for smaller sample sizes than standard probability surveys, and the lower associated costs allow for more frequent sampling.",

The main objective of the survey is to obtain national estimates of a number of key indicators (including international standardized indicators) important to monitoring progress of the national HIV/AIDS/STDs programme. The survey provides indicators on HIV/AIDS/STI-related knowledge, attitudes, and sexual behaviour, as well as information on orphans and vulnerable children, and assistance to households and communities affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The 2009 survey provides national estimates that can be dis-aggregated by residence (rural/urban), age groups (adolescents, youths, young adults and adults), and by sex (males, females).

Item characteristics that were sought in the development of the STAI scales were high internal consistency and ease and brevity of administration. The STAI A-State scale consists of 20 statements that ask people to describe how they feel at a particular moment. Construct validity was the major criterion for including each individual
A-State item in this scale. The items selected for the A-State scale had higher mean scores in a priori stressful situations (taking an exam, giving a speech) than in a neutral situation, and lower mean A-State scores in a relaxed situation. In constructing the STAI A-State scale, the essential qualities that were measured were tension, apprehension, and nervousness as these feeling states varied along a continuum of increasing levels of intensity. Low scores were expected to reflect states of calmness and serenity, intermediate scores were designed to indicate moderate levels of tension and apprehensiveness, and high scores were to correspond with intense states of fright and apprehension, approaching panic.
</p><p>The STAI A-State scale is an indicator for the transitory anxiety that is experienced by patients and clients in counseling or therapy and this scale has been used to measure changes in A-State intensity in experimental research on stress, anxiety, learning.

Research on voting lines is nonetheless hampered by a fundamental measurement problem: little is known about the distribution of time voters spend in line prior to casting ballots. We argue that early, in-person voter check-in times allow us identify individuals who waited in line to vote. Drawing on election administrative records from two General Elections in Florida---1,031,179 check-ins from 2012 and 1,846,845 from 2016---we find that minority voters incurred disproportionately long wait times in 2012 and that in-person voters who waited excessively in 2012 had a slightly lower probability---approximately one percent---of turning out to vote in 2016, ceteris paribus. These individuals also had slightly lower turnout probabilities in the 2014 Midterm Election, ceteris paribus.

Scores on this scale differentiated significantly between a sample of tolerant (N=41) and prejudiced students (N=59). The fundamentalism measure also correlated moderately with authoritarianism (r=.50), intolerance of ambiguity (r=.32), and nationalism (r=.41). However, there
is no information on reliability. In addition, Christian fundamentalism was found to be strongly related to bigotry. But no relationship was found between intolerance and frequency of church attendance, praying, Bible reading, and percentage of income contributed to one's religious group. These results suggest that cognitive rigidity, intolerance, and in-group-out-group separation are all dynamically related. Martin and Westie found a strong relationship between Christian fundamentalism and bigotry. It should also be noted, however, that no such relationship was found between intolerance and frequency of church attendance, praying, Bible reading, and percentage of income contributed to one's religious group -- all usually associated with sect membership. This pattern of results suggests a cognitive style interpretation, one in which cognitive rigidity, intolerance of ambiguity, strict adherence to church dogma, and separation between in-group and out-group members are all dynamically related.

Traditionally, these races are not salient to the public given that incumbents raise and spend little-to-no money, and campaigns, parties, and political action committees air few (if any) advertisements. Since 2010, however, such behavior has become more commonplace. I assess voter participation and incumbent performance in 178 state supreme court retention elections from 2002 to 2014.

The sociability factor involves the extent to which a person likes to meet and interact with others as well as a desire for social excitement. Although there is some debate over the propriety of combining these two subscales into one general index of extroversion/introversion, high scores on both factors appear to capture the essence of extraversion.

The method is based on computing a Gaussian local rate function of the recorded spike trains, which results in rate templates from which ASTs are drawn as gamma distributed processes with a refractory period.  Multiple instances of spike trains can be sampled from the same rate templates.  Importantly, we can manipulate rate-covariances between spike trains by performing simple algorithmic transformations on the rate templates, such as filtering our amplifying specific frequency bands, and adding behavior related rate modulations.  The method was examined for accuracy and limitations using surrogate data such as sine wave rate templates, and was then verified for recorded spike trains from cerebellum and cerebral cortex. We found that ASTs generated with this method can closely follow the firing rate and local as well as global spike time variance and power spectrum.  The method is primarily intended to generate well-controlled spike train populations as inputs for dynamic clamp studies or biophysically realistic multicompartmental models. Such inputs are essential to study detailed properties of synaptic integration with well-controlled input patterns that mimic the in vivo situation while allowing manipulation of input rate covariances at different time scales.",2019

The primary aim of the study is to better understand a number of antecedents and consequences of verbal and nonverbal emotional expressions within close relationships.
<br><br>
Participants were collected from the greater New Haven area, and the majority of participants  (97%) were between 18-50 years old.  Participants had to be romantically involved with their partner for at least 6 months to participate, and they were largely heterosexual (83%). 
<br><br>
Participants first completed an online battery of questionnaires independent from their partner.  The measures included are the following:
<br><br>
EEBQ (a measure of beliefs about expressing emotion designed by Hay & Clark), EES (Kring, Smith, & Neale, 1994), PANAS-General (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), Self-Esteem (Rosenberg, 1965), ECR-Short Form (Wei, Russell, Mallinckrodt, & Vogel, 2007), Life Orientation Scale (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994) and modifications for optimism in relationships (Bink & Clark), Relationship Satisfaction (Hendrick, 1988), Relationship Commitment (Rusbult, Martz, & Agnew, 1998), Communal Strength (Mills, Clark, Ford, & Johnson, 2004), ACT (Friedman, Prince, Riggio, & DiMatteo, 1980), BEQ (Gross & John, 1995), Trust (Rempel, Holmes, & Zanna, 1985), emotional experience and expression questions adapted from the CMU Marriage Study (1997; Clark, 2019), Self Disclosure Index and Opener Scale (Miller, Berg, & Archer, 1983), demographics.
<br><br>
After completing the online questionnaire, participants came into the lab with their partner.  After being videotaped completing two practice discussions of neutral topics (furniture and groceries), each participant generated several positive and negative topics that they could discuss with their partner.  Participants then discussed these topics together for about five minutes each, with each participant initiating a conversation on one of their negative topics as well as one of their positive topics (for a total of four conversations- one positive and one negative for each participant).  The order of discussions was counterbalanced across participants.
<br><br>
Between each of these discussions (and before the first), participants independently completed a PANAS measure (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) of their emotional experience in the moment.  Additionally, following each participant’s set of emotional topics (one positive and one negative topic for each participant), participants independently completed a series of questions (adapted from the CMU Marriage Study 1997; Clark, 2019) measuring the expression of emotion by the primary expresser in that discussion (the one who had generated the topic) as well as interpretations and consequences of that expression.
<br><br>
At the end of the study, participants completed several demographic questions about the length of their relationship (and marriage, if applicable) as well as the length of their acquaintance.  Participants were thanked, debriefed, and compensated.  We also asked participants if they would be interested in being contacted for follow up studies.

In this model, rival partisan elites send signals on the need and consequences of a proposed reform, with partisans in public adopting those positions. We apply this to test how state use of voter identification laws corresponded with public evaluations of the conduct of a state's elections.  We find the relationship between photo identification laws and confidence in state elections was polarized and conditioned by party identification in 2014.  Democrats in states with strict photo identification laws were less confident in their state's elections.  Republicans in states with strict identification laws were more confident than others. Results suggest strict photo identification laws are failing to instill broad based confidence in elections, and that the reform could correspond with diminished confidence among some.",2015

A single stage cluster sampling procedure was used to randomly select 33 communities or barangays (17 urban, 16 rural) from the Metropolitan Cebu area. The barangays, which contained about 28,000 households, were completely surveyed in late 1982 and again in early 1983 to locate all pregnant women. Women of the selected barangays who gave birth between May 1, 1983, and April 30, 1984, are included in the sample. A baseline interview was conducted among 3,327 women during the 6th to 7th month of pregnancy so that all births, including preterm births, could be identified. Subsequent surveys took place immediately after birth, then at bimonthly intervals for 24 months. From the baseline sample, there were 3,080 nontwin live births. Approximately 2,600 households were studied intensively for the full 2 years. Each survey collects detailed health, nutrition, demographic, and socioeconomic data.

Detailed community surveys of health and family planning facilities, health personnel (modern and traditional), and commercial establishments selling infant foods were undertaken on a periodic basis.

The bimonthly longitudinal surveys obtain dietary, morbidity, anthropometry, infant care, family planning, and related data. Water quality tests were conducted repeatedly over an 18-month period for all types of barangay and household water sources, and an analysis of household sources of water consumed by infants was obtained for a subsample of infants.

We examine the extent to which the use of judicial review reduces the ability of judges to achieve acceptance of their decisions, arguing that decisions made by elected judges may be more palatable to the public. Our experimental evidence demonstrates that the public is less prone to accept both decisions made by appointed judges and judicial decisions that strike down laws. However, the public is no more likely to accept the use of judicial review by an appointed court than an elected court.

The current analysis examines the comparability of results between observations and exit interviews on selected indicators using data from three countries (Ecuador, Uganda, and Zimbabwe). These two instruments differ somewhat in the type of information collected, yet there is considerable overlap. For example, observation is better at measuring accuracy of information during counseling and technical competence of the provider, whereas exit interviews provide the client's perspective on the services received. However, the two converge when clients report on the providers' actions during counseling and clinical examination. The researchers compared frequencies on selected indicators available from both instruments and calculated Kappa coefficients for agreement after linking data from observation and exit interviews for the same client. Although levels would vary across countries for a given indicator, within a country results were consistent between instruments. Agreement was good to excellent on many of the indicators. These data provide evidence that the QIQ is a reliable means of monitoring QC in family planning programs. Moreover, a number of the QC indicators can be obtained from either data collection method, raising the question of whether full implementation of both instruments is always needed. Although some programs may opt for one instrument over the other due to resource constraints, the combination provides a fuller assessment of QC.",

This project attempted to reduce vulnerability of mobile populations in Mexico to HIV/AIDS. For this project, the PLACE (Priorities for Local AIDS Control Efforts) method was carried out in Chetumal and Ciadad Hidalgo Mexico in 2001. Key informants reported 200 sites where people in these regions meet new sexual partners; researchers then visited these venues and interviewed people their about their sexual behaviors and receptivity to HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. Mobile populations in both areas mix with local residents, and attend these sites to find new sexual partners. Reported condom use at last sex was higher at Cidad Hidalgo than at Chetumal. At both areas, condoms were unavailable at most sites. Utilizing these sexual network sites
for AIDS prevention could further focus programs and would complement a strong general-population campaign. Site-based programs would also provide access to hard-to-reach mobile populations with prevention messages.",

Ghana was selected as the site for YouthSave's experimental study and impact assessment. Conducted by a team of researchers from the United States and Ghana, the Ghana Experiment investigated the viability of youth savings accounts and their potential effects on youth development outcomes, including financial, economic, education, health, and psychosocial well-being. The experiment sought to address critical gaps in research, knowledge, and practice in the field of youth financial inclusion in low and middle-income countries. The Ghana experiment was implemented in partnership with HFC Bank, the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) at University of Ghana, and the Global Social Development Innovations (GSDI) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
<br>
<br>
The Ghana Experiment used a multi-stage sampling and a cluster randomized design with two treatment conditions and one control condition. Additionally, 50 schools were randomly assigned to the treatment conditions, and the other 50 schools to the control condition. Among the 50 treatment schools, 25 schools were randomly assigned to treatment condition 1 (i.e., savings account marketing outreach), and the other 25 schools to treatment condition 2 (i.e., in-school banking services plus marketing outreach). The sample comprised an initial cohort of 6,252 and an additional cohort of 2,000 junior high school students and their parents. For the original cohort, at least 60 to 62 students were randomly selected from each school to participate in the study. For the new cohort, at least 20 students were randomly selected from each school. Baseline data were collected from the original cohort in August 2011 and the new cohort in September 2013. Follow-up data collection happened for both cohorts from July to August 2014.
<br>
<br>
With a mandate from the central bank of Ghana, HFC Bank created a tailored youth savings account targeted to youth aged 12 to 18 years and operated as a custodial account. The account was to marketed to schools in treatment condition 1 and 2. Additionally, students in treatment condition 2 were allowed make school-based savings deposits.

Given the increased attention to questions of polarization and gridlock, scholars should be particularly interested in understanding legislator decisions to collaborate across party lines. This article is primarily concerned with how institutional arrangements—specifically term limits— structure legislators’ decisions to cosponsor bills with partisan opponents. Using data on bill cosponsorship from 41 states (82 chambers), we demonstrate that term limits reduce bipartisan cosponsorship even when controlling for average legislative tenure. We argue that term limits accomplish this by altering the incentives that legislators face. In addition, we demonstrate that the effect of term limits depends on the level of legislative professionalization. When professionalization is high, the negative effect of term limits on bipartisan cosponsorship is particularly pronounced.",2015

Generally, dyads came to the lab, completed baseline self-report measures, affixed to physiological sensors that measured cardiovascular reactivity (heart rate, blood pressure, pre-ejection period, cardiac output, stroke volume, total peripheral resistance, heart rate variability). Then participants watched a negatively valenced video.  After, participants were told they would be discussing their emotional reactions to the video with another participant. One person from the dyad (the regulator) was randomly assigned to receive additional emotion regulation instructions (expressive suppression vs. expression). Participants assigned to the partner role received no additional instructions. They were simply told to converse with their partner about their emotional reactions to the video and were unaware of the instructions given to regulators. After receiving interaction instructions, regulators and partners remained in their private testing rooms for an anticipatory period during which they were given 3 min to “gather their thoughts” and prepare for the upcoming conversation. They then engaged in a 5 min video-taped conversation about the video. After the conversation participants returned to their private testing rooms for a recovery period and to complete questionnaires.",

On average, men were 38.1 years old, women were 35.2 years old. Spouses were in a relationship for 12.2 years and 87% of spouses were married for an average of 5.6 years at the start of the diary procedure. Participants had a good educational level, with 59% of men and 55% of women holding a university degree. The average number of children was 1.7 (SD= 0.8), with an average age of 4.5 years. More than 97% of men indicated at least 25 hours of professional work per week, and 76% of women indicated at least 20 hours of employment per week. 
Participants completed one part of a baseline questionnaire before they were visited in their home by research assistants, and the other part immediately after the visit. During the home visit, they were instructed on how to answer a series of questions implemented on handheld devices for the momentary assessment weeks (originally intended two 5 workday weeks, but most couples completed the surveys on the weekends also). In the following two weeks, couples answered to four momentary assessments each day:<br>
(a) before starting the workday in the morning<br>
(b) at the end of the workday, that is, during the last hour of work or on the way home<br>
(c) during the first 45 minutes after the reunion with the partner (“reunion” report)<br>

We theorize that governors’ decisions to oppose the funding should depend on both political demands and the level of need in the state, though politics and need are often in tension. We find that governors’ partisanship and the composition of the legislature have substantively meaningful effects on governors’ decisions, but the level of need in the state exerts little effect on governors’ decisions. This suggests that for high profile, highly politicized issues such as the Affordable Care Act, political considerations outweigh the needs of citizens and state economic conditions in gubernatorial decision making.",2014

The TSBI has proved effective in predicting interpersonal attraction in laboratory studies. The instrument is also strongly correlated with a measure of masculinity and femini

The TSBI yields correlations of .81 and .83 with the masculinity subscale for males and females, respectively, and correlations of .42 and .44 with the femininity subscale. The TSBI is also significantly related to an index of proneness to coronary heart disease with higher self-esteem Rs more likely to be classified as Type A or coronary prone. A factor analysis of the 32-item scale, using the principal axis routine of SPSS produces one large factor, although oblique rotation yields four coherent, correlated factors (for males -- confidence, dominance, social competence, and social withdrawal, and for females -- confidence, dominance, social competence, and relations to authority figures).

A female rat who has recently given birth (the “Target Dam”) chooses between two groups of pups.  The experiment takes place in a chamber which accommodates the target dam, and has two cups (the left and right “sides”) for the two groups of newborn rats.  Each group comprises four pups: two males and two females, all from the same mother.  (The Target Dam is never the Pup Dam (biological mother) on days PPD1 or PPD3, but the Target Dam can be the same as the Pup Dam on day PPD5.)    The two groups always have different mothers.  Thus, there are eight pups and the Target Dam in each experiment. The test day (DAY) is the post-partum day of the Target Dam and the Pup Dam. In other words, it is the number of days the Target Dam has been a mom, and the age in days of the pups. NOTE: The pups in this experiment were also used in Experiment 4, which analyzed their vocalizations. The Target Dam, having recently given birth, engages in the usual maternal behavior of herding the pups together against her body for feeding.  A common behavior is for the Target Dam to grab a pup by the scruff of the neck and carry it back to the main room.  The TD carries one pup at a time, but can go back for more pups.  Zero to four pups from each group can be moved in this fashion. The behavior of the TD is videotaped for later coding by Sarah and/or undergraduates.  A fancy computer recording setup lets the coders easily record the observed behaviors by clicking on buttons.  Several TD behaviors are recorded: 1.	  RETRIEVE ONE PUP FROM THE LEFT CHAMBER.  This button is pressed when the TD fetches a single pup. (NOTE: If that pup is the fourth pup—the last remaining pup in the chamber—the observer presses the RETRIEVE ONE PUP FROM THE RIGHT CHAMBER button instead.)  2.	RETRIEVE ONE PUP FROM THE RIGHT CHAMBER. 3.	RETRIEVE ALL PUPS FROM THE LEFT CHAMBER.   Pressed when the TD fetches the fourth (and last) pup from the left chamber. 4.	RETRIEVE ALL PUPS FROM THE RIGHT CHAMBER.   5.	HEAD IN LEFT.  The TD sticks her head in the enclosed left cup.  The cup is shielded from view of the camera, so we can’t see how she interacts with the pups in there until she fetches one out. 6.	HEAD IN RIGHT. 7.	CROUCH.  The TD nurses a retrieved pup or pups. 8.	TOUCH.  The TD touches a retrieved
pup. 9.	LICK.  The TD licks a retrieved pup. 10.	GROUP.  The TD puts the pups in a group (by picking one up and moving it into the huddle).  The TD can group a newly retrieved pup that has escaped, or she can re-group a previously grouped pup now straying off.  When the TD retrieves a pup, she has the choice of adding the pup to the huddle of other pups (“grouping” it) or setting it down outside the huddle. 11.	OTHER.  Another behavior, such as walking around the cage and not interacting with the pups. Treatments.  Both the Target Dam and the pups have been assigned to treatments (sometimes called exposures).  While pregnant, the TD may have been exposed to Cocaine (CC), exposed to saline (CS) or left untreated (UN).  Both the CC and CS treatments use syringes to deliver the medication.  Nothing is done for the UN treatment.    The treatments for the pups are similar, but are given not to the pups directly, but to their mother while pregnant with the litter.   Different experiments are done on three days: 1.	 Day 1 post partum  (the day of the pups’ birth).  The TD chooses between pups from two other mothers (never her own pups).  One group is CC and the other is always UN.  (The mother of the four pups in one group was cocaine treated, and the mother of the pups in the other group was untreated.) 2.	Day 3 is the same set-up as Day 1. 3.	Day 5.  The TD chooses between her own pups and pups from another mother.  One of three set-ups is used: a.	An UN TD chooses between her own pups and pups from a CC mom. b.	A CS TD chooses between her own pups and pups from a CC mom. c.	A CC TD chooses between her own pups and pups from a UN mom.

The sample includes 108 couple (216 individuals) who were initially enrolled 3-4 weeks prior to their marriage and were followed thereafter. All participants had to be under 35 and this had to be their first marriage. 1 male did not follow protocol and was 38 at the time of the first wave of data collection. All couples are heterosexual. The average age for men at the start was 27.2; for women it was 26.0.  92% were Caucasian.  80% had finished college. The data set was originally drawn from Pittsburgh, PA and the surrounding area.
 <br><br>
The sample was recruited at bridal fairs and by advertisements posted on bulletin board, flyers handed out in shops, electronic bulletin boards and from department stores when they filled out bridal registries for gifts (the store handed out invitations to be in our study).
<br><br>
Procedure Overview:
This is a longitudinal data set with data from both partners collected at 7 points in time:  <br> 1) a first wave of questionnaire data was collected 3-4 weeks prior to marriage, then, after marriage <br> 2) a daily diary of benefits given and received <br> 3) a laboratory session <br>  4) a second panel of questionnaire data, <br>5) a second daily diary of benefits given and received), <br>6) a third panel of questionnaire data, and <br>7) a final panel of questionnaire data.  
<br><br>
Methods:<br>
Initial Panel of Data:  This was collected 3-4 weeks prior to marriage.
 <br><br>
Each couple member independently filled out the following measures:  
 <br><br>
l.  Ratings of prototypes of norms for giving/receiving benefits in marriage in terms of how ideal they were for marriage, the extent to which the participant has been following them in the last 2 months with their fiancé and the extent to which the participant perceives the fiancé to have been doing so, the extent of success in the relationship of doing so.  (The norms were equality, need based, letting each individual seeking the highest benefits possible for him or herself, equity, tit for tat).  <br> 2.  Attachment styles   <br>
3.  Distress and depression <br>
4.  Stress <br>
5.  Stressful Life Events <br>
6.  Trust in partner <br>
7.  Communal Orientation Scale <br>
8.  Exchange Orientation Scale <br>
9.  Communal Strength Scale <br>
10. A measure of specific ""communal"" and ""exchange"" behaviors developed just for this study (unpublished)<br>
11.  A measure of global equity (Walster)<br>
12. A behavioral checklist of 148 recently performed behaviors in the marriage (which include sharing activities, self-disclosure, providing and receiving support) <br>
13. Relationship satisfaction. 
 <br><br>
Second, Third and Fourth Panels of Questionnaire Data:  
<br><br>
The initial enrollment of participants occurred across about two years. Subsequent questionnaires were spread over the following seven years. Those questionnaires repeated most of the original questions with measures of the following being added to later questionnaires:<br>
1. Reports of experiencing fear, happiness, sadness, anger, guilt, and fear (to the spouse, to family members and to acquaintances and to strangers)<br>
2. Things people collected and especially important possessions<br>
3. Self-reports of physical health.<br>
 
 <br><br>
The two daily diary studies:
<br><br>
These were collected on paper from both members of each couple. One occurred after the initial panel of questionnaire responses. A second occurred after the second panel of questionnaire responses. Participants reported (in free responses) every benefit they had intentionally given to their partner each day and every benefit they perceived that their partner had given to them (again in free responses.) It was not always easy to tell if what was said to have been given by one person in a free response matched what the partner reported receiving. For instance, one person might say he gave his partner reassurance and the partner might have reported receiving a hug. Every response was rated in terms of whether it had been voluntarily given (on a 7 point scale) and participants indicated why each was given (or why it was perceived to have been given) by filling out a checklist (e.g. to meet needs, as a repayment for a benefit given, to show care, to get the partner to give a benefit back,  to keep the benefits given and received equal/even, to avoid a negative reaction, to please the other, to feel needed or useful, because our needs were equal and it's my turn to give the benefit, out of duty/responsibility). Every response was also rated in terms of how it made the person giving the benefit (or receiving it) feel by circling all emotions felt from a list (happy, sad, fearful, surprised, angry, resentful, needed, relieved, content, caring, trusted, owed a repayment, secure, loved, indebted, guilty, competent, incompetent, cared-for, uneasy, worried, anxious, grateful, proud, responsible, loving, nothing, other.  
 <br><br>
The in lab puzzle session:  
<br><br>
This was largely conducted to examine whether couples kept track of individual inputs into joint tasks for which there would be a joint reward. Yet couples seemed to interpret it as a game and rather than seeing it as a joint task to which each was contributing they interpreted it as a competitive game and, thus, results were impossible to interpret.

WILIS 1 had two major parts. Part 1 built an in-depth understanding of educational, workplace, career and retention issues faced by LIS graduates using the life course perspective fr
om the social sciences. This part of the research was sited in North Carolina where a full range of LIS program types exist. One of the programs is in a historically Black institution, allowing a focus on minority career and retention issues. Part 2 used the methods developed in Part 1 to generate a transferable model for career tracking of LIS graduates nationally.  In Part 1, the study developed a comprehensive web-based survey to collect data on the long term career patterns of those who graduated from LIS programs in North Carolina.  The survey collected data on the educational and career histories of respondents, as well as data related to demographics, specific jobs held, breaks in employment, continuing education, opinions about trends in LIS, satisfaction with LIS as a career and perspectives of recent graduates about their LIS programs and entry into the workforce. Respondents were asked to identify up to five specific jobs in terms of the following categories: job immediately before their LIS program, job immediately after their LIS program, current job or last job depending on employment status, longest job and highest-achieving job. The response rate for the WILIS 1 study was 35% (n=2660).",2012

The 1998 TIGER/Line files (version 24) have been improved through increased editing of address ranges and the addition of ZIP+4 codes. The street names and address ranges in the Census TIGER data base were compared to those in the ZIP+4 file of the US Postal Service.

Fewer than four percent of these respondents graduated prior to 2003. Programs with multiple degrees were able to select the degree programs included in their sample. The graduates received an email invitation and three email reminders.  A few programs mailed paper invitations to encourage better response rates.   The response rate for the survey was 41% (n=3507).

<p>The evaluation employs a two-arm, stratified cluster-randomized trial, where a secondary school is a cluster and a learner is the unit of observation/analysis. A sample of schools was randomly selected and assigned to intervention and control arms for a longitudinal observation of Grade-8 female learners (data collected at baseline in year 2016, midline in 2017, and endline in 2018). The impact (at the end of 2018) of the new program is measured by comparing the incidence of HSV-2, or pregnancy, among the cohort of Grade-8 female learners enrolled in the selected schools in 2016 (hereafter referred to as “the cohort of female learners”), in the intervention and control arms. The cohort of female learners in the intervention and control arms took part in an annual panel survey from 2016 to 2018. Biomarkers for HSV-2 were collected from the cohort of female learners at baselinein 2016 and again at endline in 2018. All biomarker samples collected in 2018 were tested for HSV-2. Additionally, all the biomarkers were tested for HIV at endline, which permites assessment of HIV prevalence among the cohort of female learners at endline. The cohort of female learners were followed even if they dropped out of school after baseline, to ensure a complete picture of intervention effects.  </p>

<p>Additionally, cross-sectional samples of  male learners in Grade-8 at baseline, Grade-9 at midline, and Grade-10 at endline in the same schools participated in the baseline, midline, and endline surveys, respectively; no effort was made to link the male learners over time. Likewise, cross-sectional samples of female learners in Grade-9 at midline and Grade-10 at endline in the same schools participated in the midline and endline surveys, respectively.  Again, no effort was made to link the male learnrs over time. Likewise, a cross-sectional sample of Grade-10 female learners at baseline in the same schools participated in the baseline survey. </p>

BACKGROUND
Tobacco, alcohol, and sugar consumption contribute to cancer burden. An evidence-based population-level intervention to reduce intake of tobacco, alcohol, and sugar-added products is the implementation of policies that increase their price. This can be done through excise taxes, mitigation fees, bans on discounts, and minimum prices. Yet, the adoption of these evidence-based policies has received only limited traction, and public support is undermined by industry-led efforts to oppose policy interventions. This proposal is guided by a working hypothesis that public acceptance of different tax and non-tax pricing interventions for cancer risk behaviors varies by: (a) policy type, (b) the way the message is framed, and (c) the cancer-causing product it addresses.

We examine this working hypothesis through specific aims to: (1) identify and optimize ways to communicate price policy options for cancer-causing products to the public and (2) explore the effects of policy type, frames, and behavioural domain on public policy support.
<p>
PARTICIPANTS
Participants in the interview stage (qualitative) will be: 6 members of the public, 6 cancer survivors, and 6 cancer policy advocates – half of each stakeholder group will be in each country. Participants in the quantitative study will be solicited by Qualtrics's Survey Panels service (n=1800).
<p>
METHODS
This project will use a mixed-methods approach to understand the framing of tax and non- tax pricing policy interventions to reduce consumption of cancer-causing products. We will conduct formative qualitative research with stakeholders, identify frames to test, and pilot the frames in a quantitative study. We will then implement a 3x3x4 factorial experiment to assess the impact of the frames, cancer-causing products discussed, and pricing policy options on support for policies among UK and US adults.",2019-04-12

In contrast, we argue that securing the support of partisans and non-partisans alike should be evaluated based on how a legislator performs in office, and that the so-called normal and personal vote need not be viewed as in conflict.

Partisan polarization of state lawmakers on voter ID laws is well known but we know very little with respect to other determinants driving this political division. With rare exceptions, a major shortcoming of extant research evaluating the passage of voter ID bills stems from using the state legislature as the unit of analysis. We depart from existing scholarship by using the state legislator as our primary unit of analysis and we cover the entirety of the period when restrictive voter ID laws became a frequent agenda item in state legislatures, from the first passage of a strict photo ID bill in 2005 to the latest measures passed in 2013. Beyond the obviously significant effect of party affiliation, we find that there exists a notable relationship between the racial composition a member’s district, region, and electoral competition, and the likelihood that a state lawmaker supports a voter ID bill. Democratic lawmakers representing substantial black district populations are more opposed to restrictive voter ID laws, whereas Republican legislators with substantial black district populations are more supportive. Controlling for party, we find southern lawmakers (particularly Democrats) to be more opposed to restrictive voter ID legislation. Further, all else equal, we find black legislators in the South to be the least supportive of restrictive voter ID bills, which is likely tied to the historical context associated with state laws restricting electoral participation. Finally, in those state legislatures where electoral competition is not int
ense, partisan polarization over voter ID laws is less stark, which likely reflects the expectation that the reform will have little bearing on the outcome of state legislative contests.",2015-12

In the last decade, the health, nutrition, and population sector program of Bangladesh has adopted a national strategy for maternal health focusing on Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) for reducing maternal mortality, focusing especially on early detection and appropriate referral of complications, and improvement of quality of care. Since 2001, the government embarked on program to retrain existing government community health care workers as Community Skilled Birth Attendants (CSBA) as the primary operational strategy for achieving the 2015 target of 50 percent skilled attendance at birth.

<br/><br/>  The 1994-95 follow-up study of women and children from the original CLHNS was undertaken beginning in October of 1994 and was completed in October of 1995. Approximately 2,300 women from the original CLHNS sample were located and interviewed. In addition a new sample of about 500 women between the ages of 15 and 25 were recruited. The resulting total sample of 2800 women represented ages from 15 to 55. Basic questionnaire modules from the original and 1991 follow-up surveys were admi

This design requires collecting baseline and endline data in program intervention areas and similar comparison areas, which serve as the counterfactual for the impact evaluation. The 2014 NHSDP baseline survey is the first of the two surveys. The main objective of the survey was to measure USAID performance indicators related to health and family planning that the program seeks to improve in program intervention areas and in similar comparison areas (where NHSDP is not in operation). The survey provides baseline characteristics for assessing the program’s performance at the population level. Additionally, the survey collected information on individual, household, and neighborhood-level characteristics associated with health outcomes and health behaviors.

In addition, they request unnecessary work. Is there a less deceptive alternative? In this manuscript I present results from a field experiment with state legislative offices that minimizes the use of deception. Consistent with elite correspondence audit studies, I find evidence of discrimination against Hispanics among state legislative offices. Additionally, I find that discrimination is mitigated when subjects believe their behavior will be public knowledge. This suggests that discrimination can be mitigated through increased monitoring.

The series excludes data on self-employed individuals, employees of private households, railroad employees, agricultural production employees, and most government employees. Data from the County Business Patterns series are published primarily on the basis of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Earlier County Business Patterns data were published according to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)system. While many of the individual NAICS industries correspond directly to industries as defined under the SIC system, most of the aggregate NAICS groupings do not. Particular care should be taken in comparing data for retail trade, wholesale trade, and manufacturing, which are sector titles used in both NAICS and SIC, but cover somewhat different groups of industries. For more information on NAICS and changes from the SIC system, go to www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html. The 1999 County Business Patterns series includes the following NAICS sectors: Forestry, Fishing, Hunting, and Agriculture, Mining, Utilities, Construction, Manufacturing, Wholesale Trade, Retail Trade, Transportation and Warehousing, Information, Finance and Insurance, Real Estate and Rental and Leasing, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, Management of Companies and Enterprises, Administrative and Support and Waste, Educational Services, Health Care and Social Assistance, Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation, Accommodation and Food Services, Other Services, Auxiliaries and Unclassified.

Partisan polarization of state lawmakers on voter ID laws is well known but we know very little with respect to other determinants driving this political division. With rare exceptions, a major shortcoming of extant research evaluating the passage of voter ID bills stems from using the state legislature as the unit of analysis. We depart from existing scholarship by using the state legislator as our primary unit of analysis and we cover the entirety of the period when restrictive voter ID laws became a frequent agenda item in state legislatures, from the first passage of a strict photo ID bill in 2005 to the latest measures passed in 2013. Beyond the obviously significant effect of party affiliation, we find that there exists a notable relationship between the racial composition a member’s district, region, and electoral competition, and the likelihood that a state lawmaker supports a voter ID bill. Democratic lawmakers representing substantial black district populations are more opposed to restrictive voter ID laws, whereas Republican legislators with substantial black district populations are more supportive. Controlling for party, we find southern lawmakers (particularly Democrats) to be more opposed to restrictive voter ID legislation. Further, all else equal, we find black legislators in the South to be the least supportive of restrictive voter ID bills, which is likely tied to the historical context associated with state laws restricting electoral participation.

In one description, the person is black, in the other, the person is of mixed-race. Rs then evaluate the stimulus person.</p><p>IMPORTANT NOTE: In the CAPS87 version of AMBIGETH, the stimulus persons were white and mixed-race. In the CAPS/88 version they are black and mixed race.</p><p>Background: Recent research investigating the perception of interracial couples (Wade,
1984, 1985) revealed that under some conditions subjects would perceive an interracial couple of the type black male/white female positively. Those conditions were, the black male must be of high status and the white female must be attractive. Though subjects perceived this couple positively, they reported that interracial couples should not have children. Subjects felt that interracial children would have difficulty with society because one parent was of a different race.
</p><p>Very little empirical literature exists regarding interracial children and the existent literature is inconclusive. Some interracial children are perceived negatively and have difficulty with society (Benson, 1981). However, other literature suggests that interracial children may be perceived negatively, but are at an advantage in society (Poussaint 1984). Poussaint (1984) states that these children benefit from being exposed to two different cultures. Durojaiye (1970) supports this he re
ports that interracial children are often more popular with their white peers than are black children and interracial children are more popular with black children than are white children. These findings are based on verbal reports from interracial children and not actual reports from observers. Therefore, research examining the perceptions of interracial children from an observer's point of view is needed. If interracial children are more popular with white males and females than black children, This suggests a continuum of race exists such that whites are most popular with whites, followed by interracials, followed by blacks.

The knowledge section of the ZSBS assessed whether or not Zambians had heard of HIV/AIDS if they knew how and how it is not transmitted, if they knew how to prevent infection, and if they had been tes
ted. The attitude section of the ZSBS asked respondents about their attitudes towards an HIV-infected individual: whether they should allowed to work, whether respondents would share a meal with or buy goods from such an individual, and whether a respondent would want a family member's HIV+ status kept secret. The practice section of the ZSBS asked respondents aobut their own high-risk practices: sex with a non-regular partner, having sex with an extra-marital partner, and their prevalences of other sexually transmitted infections.

WILIS 1 had two major parts. Part 1 built an in-depth understanding
of educational, workplace, career and retention issues faced by LIS graduates using the life course perspective from the social sciences. This part of the research was sited in North Carolina where a full range of LIS program types exist. One of the programs is in a historically Black institution, allowing a focus on minority career and retention issues. Part 2 used the methods developed in Part 1 to generate a transferable model for career tracking of LIS graduates nationally.  In Part 1, the study developed a comprehensive web-based survey to collect data on the long term career patterns of those who graduated from LIS programs in North Carolina.  The survey collected data on the educational and career histories of respondents, as well as data related to demographics, specific jobs held, breaks in employment, continuing education, opinions about trends in LIS, satisfaction with LIS as a career and perspectives of recent graduates about their LIS programs and entry into the workforce. Respondents were asked to identify up to five specific jobs in terms of the following categories: job immediately before their LIS program, job immediately after their LIS program, current job or last job depending on employment status, longest job and highest-achieving job. The response rate for the WILIS 1 study was 35% (n=2660).",2012

Besides monetary resources, political candidates also consider rhetoric a top machinery. Rhetoric, or the effective use of language to persuade, has been a common research interest, particularly how politicians utilize it. Unique in this study is the probe on the rhetoric of a neophyte political candidate, Senator Grace Poe, who vied for presidency during the Philippine elections in 2016. Using the framework of discourse analysis, the researcher looked into the three appeals of rhetoric—the ethos, pathos, and logos—and the different rhetorical strategies that Senator Poe used in one of her campaign speeches. Results revealed that Poe attempted to build her credibility through her father, the late actor Fernando Poe, Jr., who also ran for president but lost. As an emotional strategy, she reminisced her father’s past experiences and reminded the audience about the desirable attributes of Filipinos, which clearly attempted to incite emotions to win the audience’s support. Moreover, logical reasoning was also present in her rhetoric by proving claims through non-negotiable ideas and cause-effect relationship. She as well did not miss to utilize rhetorical devices such as repetition, rhetorical questions, meaningful use of we and I, and modality. Overall, Poe’s skill to demonstrate rhetoric has not realized strong persuasiveness to influence popular votes.",2017-10-01

Traditionally, safety and injury analysis has occurred in siloed fields, with road safety researchers relying predominately on police-recorded crash reports, and public health researchers relying on hospitalization records. Depending on the context of the study and the database used, findings vary. This is the case for the micro-level (e.g., injury severity of an individual) to the macro-level (e.g., injury rate) scale.

This project begins to map disparate data sets to inform questions surrounding crashes. The data-mapping process will aim to build linkages between police-crash datasets and other datasets (i.e., incident-oriented data, spatial data, emerging datasets) and scale it up to larger geographic areas. Efforts to augment crash data are not new. A notable health-oriented example which sought to link health and police records was the Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System (CODES). Although this federal program ended in 2013, some states, including California, North Carolina, and Tennessee, have continued this effort.

Added data and analytics resulted in a more “complete picture” of crashes and injuries. This complete picture enables researchers to improve their modeling, assist policy makers, and contribute to visualization that helps tell compelling safety stories that guide safety improvements.

There, the participants participated in a series of structured videorecorded conversations, and privately answered brief questionnaires after each conversation. Topics were:
<br>
-	A major sacrifice they had made for their partner over the course of their relationship (sacrifice conversation).
<br>
-	A disclosure of a time of personal suffering (suffering conversation).
<br>
-	A time when they had experience a great deal of love for their partner (love conversation)

In this paper we develop a model of post-punctuation policy change grounded in theories of boundedly rational decision-making by policymakers.  Uncertain about how well the new policy will perform, policymakers learn to rely on competing interest groups for information, or, under certain circumstances look to other political jurisdictions for cues on how their policies ought to be further refined.  We test our predictions by studying changes in state charter school laws from 1996 to 2014.  We find evidence of policy change, and even convergence, across states suggesting that policies after punctuation do change in ways explained as reactions to political pressures in an environment fraught with uncertainty.",

Government spending on social insurance and direct assistance can reduce not only poverty and income inequality, but also aggregate income volatility. This outcome of social policy is not well understood, and theory suggests that the effectiveness of spending in managing insecurity is conditional on context. Informal social institutions fostering coordination could directly affect economic insecurity, but can further shape the implementation of public policy with real economic implications. Evidence from the U.S. states from 1987-2010 fails to support a benevolent social capital thesis, and suggests an adverse interaction between social capital and public policy implementation. Not only is social capital associated with greater economic insecurity, but the findings here suggest it also mitigates the effectiveness of social policy in securing income stability in the U.S. states.",2018-01-25

The qualitative study will inform the design of the quantitative study. Quantitative analysis will be conducted by Florida International University. University College London will conduct a small pilot experiment also using Qualtrics Panels. 
<p><p>
BACKGROUND
Tobacco, alcohol, and sugar consumption contribute to cancer burden. An evidence-based population-level intervention to reduce intake of tobacco, alcohol, and sugar-added products is the implementation of policies that increase their price. This can be done through excise taxes, mitigation fees, bans on discounts, and minimum prices. Yet, the adoption of these evidence-based policies has received only limited traction, and public support is undermined by industry-led efforts to oppose policy interventions. This proposal is guided by a working hypothesis that public acceptance of different tax and non-tax pricing interventions for cancer risk behaviors varies by: (a) policy type, (b) the way the message is framed, and (c) the cancer-causing product it addresses.
<p>
AIMS
We examine this working hypothesis through specific aims to: (1) identify and optimize ways to communicate price policy options for cancer-causing products to the public and (2) explore the effects of policy type, frames, and behavioural domain on public policy support.
<p>
PARTICIPANTS
Participants in the interview stage (qualitative) will be: 6 members of the public, 6 cancer survivors, and 6 cancer policy advocates – half of each stakeholder group will be in each country. Participants in the quantitative study will be solicited by Qualtrics's Survey Panels service (n=1800).
<p>
METHODS
This project will use a mixed-methods approach to understand the framing of tax and non- tax pricing policy interventions to reduce consumption of cancer-causing products. We will conduct formative qualitative research with stakeholders, identify frames to test, and pilot the frames in a quantitative study. We will then implement a 3x3x4 factorial experiment to assess the impact of the frames, cancer-causing products discussed, and pricing policy options on support for policies among UK and US adults.",2019-04-12

The initial trial phase for LEAP began in 2008, and then the program gradually expanded in 2009 and 2010. By early 2015 the program was active across Ghana and reached over 90,000 households.

In 2015-2017 a pilot program called LEAP 1000 expanded eligibility criteria for the LEAP program, focusing on households with mothers and infants during the infants’ first 1000 days of life. It was aimed at improving infant nutrition and preventing stunting. The pilot focused on an initial 6,000 households in 10 districts that received bi-monthly cash transfers.

The barangays, which contained about 28,000 households, were completely surveyed in late 1982 and again in early 1983 to locate all pregnant women. Women of the selected barangays who gave birth between May 1, 1983, and April 30, 1984, are included in the sample. A baseline interview was conducted among 3,327 women during the 6th to 7th month of pregnancy so that all births, including preterm births, could be identified. Subsequent surveys took place immediately after birth, then at bimonthly intervals for 24 months. From the baseline sample, there were 3,080 nontwin live births. Approximately 2,600 households were studied intensively for the full 2 years. Each survey collects detailed health, nutrition, demographic, and socioeconomic data.

The bimonthly longitudinal surveys obtain dietary, morbidity, anthropometry, infant care, family planning, and related data.

The current analysis examines the comparability of results between observations and exit interviews on selected indicators using data from three countries (Ecuador, Uganda, and Zimbabwe). These two instruments differ somewhat in the type of information collected, yet there is considerable overlap. For example, observation is better at measuring accuracy of information during counseling and technical competence of the provider, whereas exit interviews provide the client's perspective on the services received. However, the two converge when clients report on the providers' actions during counseling and clinical examination. The researchers compared frequencies on selected indicators available from both instruments and calculated Kappa coefficients for agreement after linking data from observation and exit interviews for the same client. Although levels would vary across countries for a given indicator, within a country results were consistent between instruments. Agreement was good to excellent on many of the indicators. These data provide evidence that the QIQ is a reliable means of monitoring QC in family planning programs. Moreover, a number of the QC indicators can be obtained from either data collection method, raising the question of whether full implementation of both instruments is always needed. Although some programs may opt for one instrument over the other due to resource constraints, the combination provides a fuller assessment of QC.",

Other research finds that minorities receive worse representation when they constitute a larger share of a constituency. We argue that minority composition will have an independent effect on representation, but that this effect will differ depending on the representative’s partisanship. We apply this theory to Latino composition and state legislative voting on immigration policy. We find that Latino composition has little effect on voting among Democratic legislators, who are less likely to vote in a restrictive direction on immigration than Republicans. However, Republicans are more likely to vote to restrict immigration as Latinos comprise a larger share of their district.

Fetal death data are limited to deaths occurring within the United States to U.S. residents and nonresidents. Fetal deaths occurring to U.S. citizens outside the United States are not included in this data file. In NCHS tabulations by place of residence, fetal deaths to nonresidents of the United States are excluded. The foreign resident records can be identified by code 4 in tape location 7 of the data tape. In addition, the majority of fetal death tables published by NCHS include only those fetal deaths with stated or presumed gestation of 20 weeks or more (see the Technical Appendix). Those records identified with a 2 in tape location 5 are included in these tabulations. All other records are excluded. Effective January 1, 1989, a revised U-S. Standard Report of Fetal Death replaced the 1978 revision. The 1989 revision provides a wide variety of new information on maternal and fetal health characteristics. Questions on complications of labor and delivery and congenital anomalies of fetus were changed from an open-ended question to a checkbox format to improve reporting of information. Several new items were added that improve the data files value for monitoring and research of factors affecting fetal mortality. The Office of Management and Budget revised its designation of metropolitan statistical areas based on figures from the 1990 Census.

Other geographic changes based on the 1990 Census will be implemented later. NCHS has adopted a new policy on release of vital statistics unit record data files. This new policy was implemented with the 1989 vital event files to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of individuals and institutions. As a result, this file does not contain the actual day of the death. The geographic detail is also restricted-only counties and cities of 100,000 or more population based on the 1980 Census as well as metropolitan areas of 100,000 or more population based on the 1990 Census, are identified.

The Politics and Prosecutors Project is a non-partisan initiative that studies elected prosecutors in the United States. Creating the database required the collection, compilation, and analysis from many state and county sources. The resulting database includes records of elections from 2014-2017 in each state that elects either an Attorney General or local prosecutors, as well as records of hundreds of thousands of distinct contributions to their campaigns. The creation of the Database of Campaign Contributions in Prosecutorial Elections was made possible by a generous gift from the Vital Projects Fund, Inc. ",

Connectivity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) matures through adolescence, coinciding with emergence of adult executive function and top-down inhibitory control over behavior. Alcohol exposure during this critical period of brain maturation may affect development of PFC and frontolimbic connectivity. Adult rats exposed to adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE; 5 g/kg ethanol, 25 percentv/vin water, intragastrically, 2-day-on, 2-day-off, postnatal day 25–54) or water control underwent resting-state functional MRI to test the hypothesis that AIE induces persistent changes in frontolimbic functional connectivity under baseline and acute alcohol conditions (2 g/kg ethanol or saline,intraperitoneally administered during scanning). Data were acquired on a Bruker 9.4-T MR scanner with rats under dexmedetomidine sedation in combination with isoflurane. Frontolimbic network regions-of-interest for data analysis included PFC [prelimbic (PrL), infralimbic (IL), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) portions], nucleus accumbens (NAc),caudate putamen (CPu), dorsal hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, amygdala, and somatosensory forelimb usedas a control region. AIE decreased baseline resting-state connectivity between PFC subregions (PrL-IL and IL-OFC)and between PFC-striatal regions (PrL-NAc, IL-CPu, IL-NAc, OFC-CPu, and OFC-NAc). Acute ethanol induced negative blood-oxygen-level-dependent changes within all regions of interest examined, along with significant increases in functional connectivity in control, but not AIE animals. Together, these data support the hypothesis that binge-like adolescent alcohol exposure causes persistent decreases in baseline frontolimbic (particularly frontostriatal) connectivity and alters sensitivity to acute ethanol-induced increases in functional connectivity in adulthood.<br><br>

It served as an exercise in MOH-led data collection using the LQAS methodology. LQAS is a relatively rapid and inexpensive approach to data collection for monitoring and evaluation purposes. Used to empower program managers to evaluate program performance, the LQAS method enables these managers to assess whether program objectives and targets have been achieved within a specific unit of interest (a geographical area, a facility, an organization, or any other catchment area). The LQAS data collection method provides a viable alternative to traditional surveys. The method allows for smaller sample sizes than standard probability surveys, and the lower associated costs allow for more frequent sampling.",

The ZIP, FIPS county subdivision, and place codes are useful in determining the correct census tract number when streets with identical names and ranges exist in different parts of the same county. Contiguous block segments that have consecutive address ranges along a street and that have the same geographic codes (State, county, census tract, ZIP, county subdivision, and place) have been collapsed together and are represented by a single record with a single address range.

The second area of need is in the field of ecological momentary assessment, also referred to as experience sampling: researchers in a wide variety of fields, spanning from the social sciences to psychology to clinical medicine, would like to be able to capture daily or even more frequent data from research subjects while in their natural environment. Survalytics is an open-source solution for the collection of survey responses as well as arbitrary analytic metadata from users of Android OS applications. Surveys may be administered in any combination of one-time questions and ongoing questions. The module may be deployed as a standalone app for experience sampling purposes or as an add-on to existing apps.  The module takes advantage of free-tier NoSQL cloud database management offered by the Amazon Web Services DynamoDB platform to package a secure, flexible, extensible data collection module. DynamoDB is capable of HIPAA-compliant storage of personal health information.  The provided example app may be used without modification for a basic experience sampling project, and we provide example questions for daily collection of blood glucose data from study subjects. The module will help researchers in a wide variety of fields rapidly develop tailor-made Android apps for a variety of data collection purposes.",2015-11-24

While most attention to stakeholder participation in public decision processes has focused on legislative policymaking or the role of industry stakeholders in regulatory processes, strategic choices about participation by non-industry stakeholders in rulemaking remains largely overlooked, particularly at the state-level. Previous research shows that agency rulemaking processes often provide greater procedural access to industry actors, who may significantly influence final rule content by bringing greater technical knowledge to bear on rulemaking processes. Less is understood about the strategies used by non-industry stakeholders, such as environmental advocacy groups, to influence regulatory decisions. This study, which compares environmental rulemaking processes across three issues in five states, finds that industry actors and environmental advocacy groups both use a variety of participation strategies classically thought to be ‘insider’ and ‘outsider’ strategies, and that these choices are motivated by reasons other than the perceived effectiveness of the strategy within the formal rulemaking process.",2018-10-26

<p>The emissions modeling platform uses SMOKE v4.7 to apportion the emissions inventories into the grid cells used by CMAQ and temporalizes the emissions into hourly values. In addition, the pollutants in the inventories (e.g., NOx, PM and VOC) are split into the chemical species needed by CMAQ.  For the purposes of preparing the CMAQ- ready emissions, the NEI emissions inventories by data category are split into emissions modeling platform “sectors”; and emissions from sources other than the NEI are added, such as the Canadian, Mexican, and offshore inventories. Emissions within the emissions modeling platform are separated into sectors for groups of related emissions source categories that are run through all of the SMOKE programs, except the final merge, independently from emissions categories in the other sectors.  
(See pre-merged sector files below.)</p>

<br>
<p>
The final merge program called Mrggrid combines low-level sector-specific gridded, speciated and temporalized emissions to create the final CMAQ-ready emissions inputs. For biogenic emissions, the CMAQ model allows for biogenic emissions to be included in the CMAQ-ready emissions inputs, or for biogenic emissions to be computed within CMAQ itself (the “inline” option).  (See merged 2D files below)
</p>
<br>
<p>This study uses the inline biogenic emissions option. Table 3-1 from the following report https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-11/documents/2017_emissionschapter.pdf presents the sectors in the emissions modeling platform used to develop the year 2017 emissions for this project. 
</p>
<p>
The emissions inventories created for input to SMOKE, are based on the April, 2020 version of the 2017 NEI. The NEI includes five main data categories: a) nonpoint (formerly called “stationary area”) sources; b) point sources; c) nonroad mobile sources; d) onroad mobile sources; and e) fires. For CAPs, the NEI data are largely compiled from data submitted by state, local and tribal (S/L/T) agencies.  HAP emissions data are often augmented by EPA when they are not voluntarily submitted to the NEI by S/L/T agencies.  The NEI was compiled using the Emissions Inventory System (EIS).  EIS includes hundreds of automated QA checks to improve data quality, and it also supports release point (stack) coordinates separately from facility coordinates.  EPA collaboration with S/L/T agencies helped prevent duplication between point and nonpoint source categories such as industrial boilers.  
</p>
<p>
The 2017 NEI Technical Support Document describes in detail the development of the 2017 emission inventories and is available at https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/2017-national-emissions-inventory-nei-technical-support-document-tsd (EPA, 2020a). Point source data from the 2017 NEI, including data submitted to EIS by S/L/T agencies, were used for this study. EPA used the SMARTFIRE2 system and the BlueSky emissions modeling framework to develop year 2017 fire emissions.  SMARTFIRE2 categorizes all fires as either prescribed burning or wildfire categories, and the Bluesky framework includes emission factor estimates for both types of fires.  Onroad and nonroad mobile source emissions for year 2017 were developed by running MOVES2014b (https://www.epa.gov/moves).  Canadian emissions interpolated to the year 2017 from 2015 and 2023 were used, and Mexican emissions were for the year 2016.  
</p>

<p>
The 2017 Emission Modeling Platform is primarily based on the 2017gb emissions case prepared by EPA, but there are differences between this package and the EPA emissions case:
</p>
<p>
- This package includes a newer airports inventory from 2017 NEI than was used in the 
  original 2017gb emissions case. This newer version, which was not available until after the 2017gb emissions case was completed in May 2020, corrects an overestimation of emissions from airports.
- This package includes average speed distributions (SPDIST) from 2017. The original 2017gb emissions case used average speed distributions from 2016. This is an input to SMOKE-MOVES and affects the ""RPD"" category of onroad emissions.

So, what makes groups of states successful when they lobby the Supreme Court as amicus curiae filers? I argue that it is not just the number of states included in a coalition that matters, but rather which states are included. In this paper I offer a theory that implies certain types of coalitions will be more influential than others, as these coalitions can vary in how representative they are of public preferences. I use a dataset on state amicus curiae filings from 1960 to 2013 to test the implications of my theory. I find that the regional diversity of coalitions increases the odds of state amicus curiae filers obtaining their preferred outcome, but the ideological heterogeneity of the group of states does not. This latter result is interesting given that it is contrary to the theoretical expectations of the existing scholarship on state amicus filings.",2019-07-18

The series is useful for studying the economic activity of small areas, analyzing economic changes over time, and as a benchmark for statistical series, surveys, and databases between economic censuses. Businesses use the data for analyzing market potential, measuring the effectiveness of sales and advertising programs, setting sales quotas, and developing budgets. Government agencies use the dat

The series excludes data on self-employed individuals, employees of private households, railroad employees, agricultural production employees, and most government employees. Data from the County Business Patterns series are published primarily on the basis of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Earlier County Business Patterns data were published according to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)system. While many of the individual NAICS industries correspond directly to industries as defined under the SIC system, most of the aggregate NAICS groupings do not. Particular care should be taken in comparing data for retail trade, wholesale trade, and manufacturing, which are sector titles used in both NAICS and SIC, but cover somewhat different groups of industries. For more information on NAICS and changes from the SIC system, go to www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html. The 1998 County Business Patterns series includes the following NAICS sectors: Forestry, Fishing, Hunting, and Agriculture, Mining, Utilities, Construction, Manufacturing, Wholesale Trade, Retail Trade, Transportation and Warehousing, Information, Finance and Insurance, Real Estate and Rental and Leasing, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, Management of Companies and Enterprises, Administrative and Support and Waste, Educational Services, Health Care and Social Assistance, Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation, Accommodation and Food Services, Other Services, Auxiliaries and Unclassified.

We relax this assumption and use Monte Carlo simulations to compare common strategies for modeling heterogeneity, testing these strategies with increasing levels of variance. We find that multilevel models with random coefficients produce the best estimates, and are a significant improvement over other models. Additionally,we show how modeling similar policies as multilevel structures allows researchers to more precisely explore the theoretical implications of heterogeneity across policies.We provide an empirical example of these modeling approaches with a unique dataset of twenty-nine anti-abortion policies.",2018-04-30

They then had a videotaped conversation where they each shared a time they ""felt a lot of love for each other and how they expressed it"". They next did an empathic accuracy task (own and perceived partner emotions after the conversation, as well as the Ickes empathic accuracy paradigm), and then completed some sexuality questionnaires. <br> <br> 

Approximately 4 months later they were emailed a brief follow-up questionnaire on Qualtrics containing relationship and sexuality measures. <br> <br>

This study was conducted at the Pennsylvania State University. The study procedure along with the sample characteristics is as follows:
<br>
<br>
SAMPLE. This EMA study consisted of 52 individuals (17 male and 35 female, mean age = 30 years, SD = 10, min = 19, max = 48). This sample consisted of students and university staff of the Pennsylvania State University and data collection occurred during the summer of 2016. We refer to this sample as the Community Sample due to the diversity in age range in our participants.  
<br>
<br>
PROCEDURE. This study was a four-week long EMA study. The day before the EMA procedure began, in the introductory session, the participants completed a battery of self-report surveys (BFI-2, Flourishing, Health, General Happiness, Gratitude, Satisfaction With Life, Meaning in Life, Authentic Happiness, PERMA Profiler) and demographics items. They then provided informed consent and their respective phone numbers were registered with the text messaging service SurveySignal (SurveySignal, LLC, 2015). Text messages to complete the EMA surveys were sent to the participants' smartphones six times a day.  Survey timing was determined by dividing participants' self-reported usual waking hours into six equal-length intervals, and survey prompts were delivered at a random timing within each time interval, constrained so that no two prompts were less than 30 minutes apart.  This sampling scheme was chosen to reduce expectation biases in reporting while providing a representative sampling of the individuals' context. Web-based EMA surveys were designed in and delivered by the Qualtrics survey system (Qualtrics, Provo, UT, 2017). Over the course of the four weeks, participants received and responded to up to 168 text-message (six per day) prompted web-based EMA surveys. Each EMA survey contained 10-12 questions/statements, three of which were centered on loving feelings (“How much do you feel loved right now?”, “I love the world around me.”, “Since the last survey, I have been expressing love.”). Additional items were related to elements of well-being. After the four-week EMA data collection, in an Exit session, participants returned to the laboratory to retake the battery of self-report surveys that they completed in the introductory session (Flourishing, Health, Authentic Happiness, PERMA Profiler) plus additional questionnaires (Interpersonal Support Evaluation, Inclusion of Other in the Self, Spirituality & Religiosity, Experiences in Close Relationships-Relationship Structure, Mindfulness, General Happiness). Compliance was high, with participants completing an average of 157 (SD = 15) of the surveys. Participants were paid proportional to their response rate.

In addition, Berry and Carsey (2005) cleaned the original dataset to make it more accurate and usable; their corrections led to the release of a revised ICPSR dataset (Study #3938). The culmination of these efforts is a dataset containing information about general elections for state legislative seats from 1967 to 2003, now available through ICPSR (Study #21480).",

iversity of Florida and Duke University researchers and librarians have spearheaded a collaborative partnership project which has been awarded $240,
804 from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). This is the second largest award in Florida (and one of only 5 major grants awarded in the state) and one of 244 nationally this year. The Archive of Haitian Religion and Culture: Collaborative Research and Scholarship on Haiti and the Haitian Diaspora grant, led by project director Benjamin Hebblethwaite (UF) and co-director Laurent Dubois (Duke) will improve the understanding of a central Haitian and Haitian-American spiritual tradition, the Vodou religion, by gathering the audiovisual and textual sources of communities, by interpreting the collected materials, by expanding the holdings through a self-submission tool, and by diffusing the knowledge via an open access digital library hosted within the existing Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC; www.dloc.com). The Archive of Haitian Religion and Culture: Collaborative Research and Scholarship on Haiti and the Haitian Diaspora project is part of a tradition of scholarly work stretching back to the early 20th century that has sought to counter reductionist and racist visions of Vodou religion through ethnography, analysis of culture and music, and an exploration of the role of religion in Haiti’s founding revolution (1791-1803). Such work has long turned to the central texts of worship which are Haitian Creole language songs. This three-year project will create a freely accessible multimedia digital library that uses audiovisual technologies to curate, elucidate and facilitate the advanced search of the rich primary materials of a central Haitian and Haitian-American spiritual tradition in order to promote discovery and educate a broad public. This project will provide content online for scholars and the public in the form of: Audiovisual content available as sound, photographic or video footage that will be transcribed, translated, subtitled and explicated Textual content available as facsimile, updated modernizations and translations Critical syntheses such as commentary, exegesis, etymology, etc., available in English New works obtained through the Digital Library of the Caribbean’s self-submission tool This project’s 29 different primary and interpretative materials will be presented at the first-of-its-kind Vodou Archive digital library which is dedicated to “curating and sharing the sources of Vodou religion and culture.”",2012

A single stage cluster sampling procedure was used to randomly select 33 communities or barangays (17 urban, 16 rural) from the Metropolitan Cebu area. The barangays, which contained about 28,000 households, were completely surveyed in late 1982 and again in early 1983 to locate all pregnant women. Women of the selected barangays who gave birth between May 1, 1983, and April 30, 1984, are included in the sample. A baseline interview was conducted among 3,327 women during the 6th to 7th month of pregnancy so that all births, including preterm births, could be identified. Subsequent surveys took place immediately after birth, then at bimonthly intervals for 24 months. From the baseline sample, there were 3,080 nontwin live births. Approximately 2,600 households were studied intensively for the full 2 years. Each survey collects detailed health, nutrition, demographic, and socioeconomic data.
<br/><br/> Individual, household, and community data were collected during the baseline survey. Detailed community surveys of health and family planning facilities, health personnel (modern and traditional), and commercial establishments selling infant foods were undertaken on a periodic basis. A birth information survey was conducted to obtain information about the delivery and to determine birth weight, gestational age (including clinical assessment of low birth weight infants, infants of mothers with diabetes, and infants of mothers with no last menstrual period data). The bimonthly longitudinal surveys obtain dietary, morbidity, anthropometry, infant care, family planning, and related data. Water quality tests were conducted repeatedly over an 18-month period for all types of barangay and household water sources, and an analysis of household sources of water consumed by infants was obtained for a subsample of infants. The same subsample was used to study the etiology of diarrhea. A detailed description of this stage of the field work is provided in the Survey Procedures document.",

Also included is the SETS software needed to access and tabulate the data. The NHIS is a continuing nationwide survey of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. The purpose of the NHIS is to obtain information about the amount and distribution of illness, its effects in terms of disability and chronic impairments, and the kinds of health services
people receive. Information is obtained on the number of restricted-activity days, bed days, work- or school-loss days, and all physician visits occurring during the 2-week period prior to the week of the interview. Data are also obtained on the acute and chronic conditions that were responsible for these days or visits. Respondents are asked about long-term limitation of activity and the chronic conditions related to this disability. All conditions are coded according to the Health Interview Survey Medical Coding Manual and Short Index, a modified version of the International Classification of Diseases, using the limited diagnostic detail available from a household respondent. Data are obtained on all hospital episodes during the prior 12 months, including length of stay and whether surgery was performed. Topics included from the basic module are: Household, Family, Person, Sample Adult, Sample Child, Immunization, Injury Episode, Injury Verbatim, and Poison Episode.
