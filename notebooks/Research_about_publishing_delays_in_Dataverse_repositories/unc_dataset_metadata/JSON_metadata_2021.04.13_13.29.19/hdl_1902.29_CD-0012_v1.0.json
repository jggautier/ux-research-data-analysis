The print version of this reference source has been published since 1878 while the compact disc version first appeared in 1993. This disc is designed to serve as a convenient, easy-to-use statistical reference source and guide to statistical publications and sources. The disc contains over 1,400 tables from over 250 different gove\nrnmental, private, and international organizations. The 1997 Statistical Abstract on CD-ROM, like the book, is a statistical reference and guide to over 250 statistical publications and sources from government and private organizations. This compact disc (CD) has 1,500 tables and charts from over 250 sources. Text and tables can be viewed or searched with the software. Tables and charts cover these subjects in 31 sections and 2 appendices: Population, Vital Statistics, Health and Nutrition, Education, Law Enforcement, Courts and Prisons, Geography and Environment, Parks, Recreation and Travel, Elections, State and Local Government, Finances and Employment, Federal Government, Finances and Employment, National Defense and Veterans Affairs, Social Insurance and Human Services, Labor Force, Employment and Earnings, Income, Expenditure and Wealth, Prices, Banking, Finance and Insurance, Business Enterprise, Communications, Energy, Science, Transportation -- Land, Transportation -- Air and Water, Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries, Mining and Mineral Products, Construction and Housing, Manufactures, Domestic Trade and Services, Foreign Commerce and Aid, Outlying Areas, Comparative International Statistics, State Rankings, Population of MSAs, Congressional District Profiles. The 1997 CD includes major changes in both the content of the information on the disc and software used for accessing the information. As usual, updates have been made to most of the more than 1,400 tables that were on the previous disc with new or more recent data. The spreadsheet files for these tables usually have more information than displayed in the book or Adobe Acr\nobat files. There are also 97 new tables on such subjects as mammography, overweight persons, schools with Internet access, college remedial work, hate crimes, weather disasters, pet ownership, employer tenure, work disabilities, workplace drug testing, family net worth, family debt payments, minority- owned businesses, traffic fatalities, supply and use of various foods, several new housing tables, and international statistics for continuing education and tourism receipts. See Appendix V on the disc for a complete list of the new tables presented. In the software area, Adobe Acrobat Reader and Search engine have been added to allow users to view, navigate, search, and print on demand any of the pages from the book. Data files are included in Excel (xls) and Lotus (.wk1) spreadsheets.\n</p><p>Note to Users: This CD is part of a collection located in the Data Archive of the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
