The population-based survey consisted of a national sample of 1943 households, 97% of which responded. Individual response rates among eligible men and women were 92% and 96%, respectively. This 95-page report summarizes the ZSBS findings. Some key findings: virtually all respondents had heard of AIDS, and 86% of men and 78% of women thought that HIV infection could be avoided. Two-thirds of men and 57% of women agreed that condom use was an effective prevention method. Only 7% of respondents thought it was acceptable for a married man to have extra-marital sexual relations, but 19% of men and 29% of women thought a man could not be sexually satisfied with just one partner. One in five adults were estimated to be HIV positive by 1995; however, few people knew their HIV status, and many held negative attitudes about HIV-positive people. Sexual behavior in Zambia had not changed drastically from 1996 to 1998, though unmarried men did report fewer partners. Close to one-third of men reported using condoms in non-marital relationships, a slight decrease from 1996.\r\n</p>  <p><b>Note: The questionnaire for the 1998 SBS study is different from the 2000, 2003, 2005, and 2009 SBS studies conducted in Zambia.</b></p><p><b>[RESTRICTED DATA]</b></p> <p><b>MEASURE Evaluation Restricted Data Request Process</b></p>  <p>The documentation is publicly accessible, but the data files are available only upon request.
