This disc includes statistical information from the 1987 Economic Censuses and several related data sets. The statistics included are the same as published in corresponding printed report series, with a few exceptions (the Merchandise Line Sales, Commodity Line Sales, Location of Manufacturing Plants, and Surveys of Minority- and Women-Owned Business files include data not available i\nn print). a. Geographic Area Series -- (detailed information about establishments with payroll, by kind-of-business and by geographic areas U.S., States, metropolitan areas, counties, and places). b. Nonemployer Statistics -- (statistics about establishments with no paid employees, by kind-of-business and by geographic area, complementing the Geographic Area series). c. Industry Series -- detailed information about establishments with payroll classified by industry and, in some cases, by the types of products produced or materials consumed -- presented primarily at the national level, but with limited State data.) d. Merchandise/Commodity Line Sales -- (statistics on sales by kind-of- business by retail merchandise line or wholesale commodity line, for the U.S., States, and metropolitan areas). e. Establishment and Firm Size -- (general statistics by kind-of-business cross-tabulated by the size of the establishment or firm in terms of receipts or employment, the level of concentration in each kind of business in the largest firms, and legal form of organization -- at the national level only.) f. Survey of Minority-Owned Business Enterprises -- (information for the United States, States, the District of Columbia, MSAs, counties and places. g. Location of Manufacturing Plants -- (Frequency counts of manufacturing establishments by employment-size class by 4-digit SIC for the US, States, counties, and places.) h. Selected Historical Statistics -- Selected data from the 1982 and 1977 censuses of retail trade, wholesale trade, service industries, and manufactures support the\nstudy of change in economic characteristics over time. i. Miscellaneous Files -- Enterprise Statistics summarize the characteristics of firms rather than establishments. There is an alphabetic index to SIC codes. Also present are selected data from current programs, including data from the Annual Survey of Manufactures through 1991 and the Monthly Retail Trade survey through 1992. Users anticipating 1992 industrial census data may wish to review the Numerical List of Manufactured and Mineral Products. j. Auxiliary Files -- Area code lists feature geographic area names and kind-of-business titles.\n</p><p>Note to Users: This CD is part of a collection located in the Data Archive of the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
