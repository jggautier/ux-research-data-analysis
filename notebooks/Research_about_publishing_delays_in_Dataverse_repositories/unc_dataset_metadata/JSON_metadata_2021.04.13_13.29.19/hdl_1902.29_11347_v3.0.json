Used to empower program managers to evaluate program performance, the LQAS method enables these managers to assess whether program objectives and targets have been achieved within a specific unit of interest (a geographical area, a facility, an organization, or any other catchment area). The LQAS data collection method provides a viable alternative to traditional surveys. The method allows for smaller sample sizes than standard probability surveys, and the lower associated costs allow for more frequent sampling. This report describes effective use of LQAS in Liberia.\n<br/> <br/> Though LQAS is touted as a rapid and inexpensive data collection tool, this does not necessarily translate into implementations that are \u201cquick\u201d and \u201ccheap\u201d, especially when technical assistance is provided by an outside organization. From 2010 - 2014 MEASURE Evaluation supported 15 maternal and child health outcome monitoring surveys in Liberia."
