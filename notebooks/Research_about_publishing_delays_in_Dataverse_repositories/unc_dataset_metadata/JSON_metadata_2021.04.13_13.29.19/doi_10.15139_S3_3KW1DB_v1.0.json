National <em>Listening to Mothers</em> surveys to date were led by Childbirth Connection, which became a core program of the National Partnership for Women & Families in 2014.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<em>Listening to Mothers in California</em>, led by the National Partnership for Women & Families, is the first state-level <em>Listening to Mothers</em> survey. This population-based survey of women who gave birth in California hospitals in 2016 was carried out by core <em>Listening to Mothers</em> investigators at the National Partnership for Women & Families and at Boston University School of Public Health, joined by investigators at what is now known as the University of California San Francisco Center for Health Equity, in collaboration with the survey research firm Quantum Market Research. California Health Care Foundation and Yellow Chair Foundation funded the survey. As investigators had access to selected birth certificate items for sampling, contacting sampled women, data weighting and data analyses, the methodology of this survey differs from the methodology used in national <em>Listening to Mothers</em> surveys. Other differences between past national surveys and this state-level survey include the ability to participate in the state survey in either English or Spanish and to participate on any device, as well as with a trained interviewer. Eligible women could participate in past national surveys in English only and either on their own with a laptop or desktop computer or by telephone with a trained interviewer.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe <em>Listening to Mothers in California</em> survey questionnaire retained some core items that had been included in previous surveys, adapted others (including for mobile-first display), and included new items developed to explore the evolving U.S. health and maternity care environment and topics relevant to the California context. Topics included care arrangements, maternity care (and especially care during the hospital stay for giving birth), mode of birth, respectful and disrespectful treatment, postpartum experiences, and perinatal mental health (especially anxiety and depression). The public dataset is limited to items provided by survey participants while completing the survey, exclusive of personally identifiable information. For their analyses, the survey investigators have access to two additional sources of information about survey participants that cannot be made public: selected items on participants\u2019 birth certificates and selected items abstracted from the California Department of Health Care Services Management Information System/Decision Support System Warehouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much information about the California survey is available at either <a href=\"http://www.nationalpartnership.org/LTMCA\" target=\"blank\">www.nationalpartnership.org/LTMCA</a> or <a href=\"http://www.chcf.org/listening-to-mothers-CA\" target=\"blank\">www.chcf.org/listening-to-mothers-CA</a>.

Investigators thus arranged for the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) to identify survey participants with a 2016 Medi-Cal-paid childbirth claim in the DHCS Management Information System/Decision Support System (MIS/DSS) Warehouse. All initial survey data analyses (at <a href=\"http://www.nationalpartnership.org/LTMCA\" target=\"blank\">www.nationalpartnership.org/LTMCA</a>) and all secondary analyses by the investigator team use this \u201cgold standard\u201d identifier for participants who had Medi-Cal coverage for childbirth. The investigators went to great effort to be able to include this identifier in the public dataset, and received no response from DHCS. The Dataverse dataset therefore does not include this identifier. It does include participants\u2019 self-reports of source of payment for their childbirth, and the Kappa score of agreement between Medi-Cal-paid claim in MIS/DSS Warehouse and the women\u2019s self-reports is 0.81. Thus, there may be some discrepancies between analyses carried out by investigators and by users of the public dataset using the source of payment variable.\r\n<br></br>\r\nThe investigators also have access to selected items from participants\u2019 birth certificates, and are prohibited from including any birth-certificate-derived items in the public dataset."

Each woman who responded to the survey was assigned a weight, which stands for the number of mothers in California like herself that she represents. Weights were calculated using birth certificate records for sampled women and the final 2016 California birth data (Birth Statistical Master File), excluding births to women who would have been excluded from the sampling frame: those under age 18, those who were not residents of California, and the small number who had twins or other multiples or out-of-hospital births.<br></br>\r\nSampling weights were created to account for the stratified sample design, oversampling of specific groups, non-response among the women who were sampled, and non-coverage of women who could not be sampled because their births were not in the sampling frame (births from September 2016 through December 15, 2016). Although the survey data were weighted to the entire birthing population, minus these few exclusions, the survey was only administered in English and Spanish and results may not be generalizable to women who speak other languages. <br></br>\r\nBirth certificates do not allow us to know the exact proportion of women ineligible for our study for reasons that are not tracked through birth certificate items, including those unable to participate in English or Spanish. Despite our exclusions, our weighted results are remarkably similar to statewide results in the 2016 Birth Statistical Master File on a broad range of variables, as shown in a table in Appendix B of the full survey report."
