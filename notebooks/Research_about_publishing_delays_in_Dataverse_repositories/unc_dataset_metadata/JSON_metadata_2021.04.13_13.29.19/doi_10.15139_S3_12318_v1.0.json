Differences: The Chronic Saline is a valid treatment for the PUP DAM dam but not the TARGET. Also: The vocalization data is summarized differently.  This experiment collected ultra-sonic vocalization (USV) or \u201ccall\u201d data from rat pups in a preference-experiment set-up.  The experiment was conducted on three days:  Pup post-natal day (PND) 2 and Target Dam post-partum day (PPD) 1; pup PND 4 and Dam PPD 3; and pup PND 6 and Dam PPD 5.    The Target Dams were from either of three groups (CC, CS, and UN).  The pups were from two groups (CC and UN).    The Preference experiment (data in CPU_xx) was conducted with a standard two-lane choice apparatus.  The Baseline measurements were taken with the Target Dam in the chamber WITHOUT any pups, and observing it.  Measurements at Post-Partum Days 1, 3, and 5 were taken of the Target Dam with a pup in either side lane.  Lanes of the CC and UN pups were switched during each day.  For example, if the CC pup was placed in the left lane in PPD 1, it would be placed in the RIGHT lane in PPD3, and back to the LEFT lane in PPD 5.  These technical terms were used: \tFrequency: Number of times the behavior happened \tDuration: In seconds. How long the behavior continued \tLatency: How many seconds into test that behavior started  Each observation period lasted two minutes (about 120 seconds).  The pup was put into one of the sides of the box, and its USV cries were recorded for 60 seconds.  At this point, the Target Dam was introduced into the chamber and allowed to choose one side or the other.  Recording of the pup\u2019s cries continued during this second 60-second period.  NOTE: All pups were male, and different pups from the same Pup Dam (biological dam) were used on each day. In other words, identifiers PD_ID_LE,  PD_ID_RI,  PD_ID_CC,  PD_ID_UN,  in the dataset identify the Pup Dam uniquely but does not distinguish between the pups from that same pup dam.  This experiment was originally called \"Elizabeth Cox's USV Preference Experiment\" in L:\\Johns\\Project1\\ElizabethCox\\CoxPrefUSV\\Data\\."
