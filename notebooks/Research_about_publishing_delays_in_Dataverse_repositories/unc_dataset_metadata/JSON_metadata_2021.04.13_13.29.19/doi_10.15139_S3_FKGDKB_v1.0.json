To be eligible, participants were required to (a) be exclusively committed to their partner for 4 months or more, (b) be 18 years of age or older, (c) see each other on a daily basis, and (d) be fluent in Dutch. At the start of the study, on average, participants\u2019 age was 24.73 years old (SD = 6.44) and they had been committed to their partner for 3.76 years (SD = 4.48). Furthermore, half of our couples were living together and 7.2% of them were married. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAt the start of the study, couples came to the laboratory for an Intake session. Participants were invited to take place in separate cubicles to complete various questionnaires and an implicit partner evaluations task. At the end of the Intake session, they received both verbal and written instructions about the Diary phase of the study, which started on the following day. In this phase, every evening at 8:00pm for 14 days, each participant received an email containing a link to complete an implicit partner evaluations task on Inquisit Web (Millisecond, 2015). They were then automatically directed to Qualtrics.com to answer a short survey in which they were asked to indicate what happened during the day.\r\nAfter this, participants were contacted every 4 months over the next year in order to complete three Follow-up assessments. Thus, respectively 4, 8 and 12 months after the last daily diary assessment, they received an email that contained a link to Inquisit Web for the implicit partner evaluations task, before being directed to Qualtrics.com for a short survey regarding the past 4 months. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe study was approved by the ethical board of the faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences of the VU Amsterdam."
