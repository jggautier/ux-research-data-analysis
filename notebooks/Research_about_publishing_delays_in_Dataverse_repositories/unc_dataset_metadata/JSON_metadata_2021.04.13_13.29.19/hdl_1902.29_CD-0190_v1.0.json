The print version has been published since 1878, and a compact disc version has been available since 1993. Both are designed to serve as a convenient, easy-to-use statistical reference source and guide to statistical publications and sources. The extensive selection of statistics is provided for the United States, with selected d\nata for regions, divisions, states, metropolitan areas, cities, and foreign countries from reports and records of government and private agencies. Software on the disc can be used to perform full-text searches, view official statistics, open tables as Lotus worksheets or Excel workbooks, and link directly to source agencies and organizations for supporting information. The disc contains over 1,500 tables from over 250 different governmental, private, and international organizations. Some of the topics are population; vital statistics; health and nutrition; education; law enforcement, courts and prison; geography and environment; elections; state and local government; federal government finances and employment; national defense and veterans affairs; social insurance and human services; labor force, employment, and earnings; income, expenditures, and wealth; prices; business enterprise; science and technology; agriculture; natural resources; energy; construction and housing; manufactures; domestic trade and services; transportation; information and communication; banking, finance, and insurance; arts, entertainment, and recreation; accommodation, food services, and other services; foreign commerce and aid; outlying areas; and comparative international statistics. In recognition of this being the 125th edition of the Statistical Abstract, historical tables will be included at the beginning of each section in order to highlight related data when they first appeared in earlier editions. These cover topics such as: the number of alien\npassengers arriving in the U.S. (1819 to 1870); the number of juvenile delinquents (1890 and 1904); apportionment of congressional representation (1790 to 1900); number of pension claims filed and allowed each year (1861); and imports and exports of merchandise into and out of Alaska (1879 to 1905). We have introduced 80 new tables in this edition, including several from the American Community Survey. These cover a variety of topics including select family planning and medical services, asthma incidence among children under 18 years of age, public schools with broadband and wireless connections, state trends in identity theft, hazardous waste generated, shipped, and received by state, retail gasoline prices by selected areas, and a profile of second-home buyers. In addition, a number of new tables have been added that contain data from the 2002 Economic Census.\"\n</p><p>Note to Users: This CD is part of a collection located in the Data Archive of the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
