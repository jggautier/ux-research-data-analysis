This survey was conducted in three waves with in-person and telephone screening of households. The first wave was conducted between April and June 1996. An initial screening interview was conducted. The survey extracted a Sportsman sample (fishing and hunting) and conducted the first detailed interview. If any of the household members had participated in wild\nlife watching between January 1, 1996 and the interview date, the study sampled approximately every fourth participant (randomly selected) into the Wildlife Watching sample (formerly called nonconsumptive) and conducted the first detailed interview. The second wave of interviewing was conducted in September and October, 1996. For this wave, the study selected household members who had not participated by the Wave 1 date of interview but were likely to participate during 1996. Their likelihood of participation was determined by their past participation levels and their stated likeliness to participate in 1996. This was the first detailed interview for these respondents. It was possible for a respondent who was in the Sportsman sample in Wave 1 to be selected for the Wildlife Watching sample in Wave 2 or for a Wildlife Watching respondent in Wave 1 to be selected for the Sportsman sample for Wave 2. Wave 3 began in January 1997 and continued into the first part of March 1997. The wave 3 sample consisted of respondents from both Wave 1 and Wave 2. This was to be the second detailed interview for both samples (Sportsman and Wildlife Watching).\n</p><p>Note to Users: This CD is part of a collection located in the Data Archive of the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
