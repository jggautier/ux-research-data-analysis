(1) The Early Childhood Program Participation (ECPP) survey involved interviews with the parents or guardians of children from birth through age 6 who were not yet enrolled in kindergarten. Information was collected about participation in early childhood care and programs (relative care, nonrelative care, center-based programs, a\nnd Early/Head Start), parental perceptions of program quality, parental choice of arrangements, and family-child activities. (2) The Before- and After-School Programs and Activities survey (ASPA) involved interviews with the parents or guardians of children enrolled in kindergarten through 8th grade, up to age 15. Data were collected about enrollment in school, school characteristics and experiences; before- and after-school care arrangements, programs, and activities; and self-care. Parents of homeschoolers were asked questions about reasons for schooling their children at home, and support from their public school or district. (3) The Adult Education and Lifelong Learning survey (AELL) involved interviews with civilian adults who were age 16 and older and not enrolled in 12th grade or below. Topics included participation in the following types of educational activities: English as a second language, basic skills/GED preparation, college/university degree programs, vocational/technical programs, apprenticeships, work-related courses, personal interest classes, and informal learning activities at work.\"\n</p><p>Note to Users: This CD is part of a collection located in the Data Archive of the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.

Households are selected for the survey using random digit dialing (RDD) methods. Each collection of the NHES begins with a screening of a representative sample of households. The samples have ranged in size from 45,000 to 60,000 households. One of the goals of the NHES is to produce reliable estimates of the characteristics of children's and adults' educational experiences for the total targeted population and for domains defined by race and ethnicity. Estimates by race and ethnicity are of great interest, especially for monitoring educational trends over time. Therefore, the NHES sample design over-samples minorities in order to increase the reliability of estimates for these groups.
