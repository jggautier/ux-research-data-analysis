The original sample, drawn in 1965 and followed through 1987, was based on a two-stage sampling plan. A new sample was drawn in 1988, when a three-stage sampling plan was implemented and several data collection and estimation procedures were revised. The redesig\nn of the survey is important, especially for those conducting trend analyses. Because the new survey differs from the original one in sample design, data collection, and estimation procedures, some of the differences between NHDS statistics based on the 1965-87 sample and statistics based on the sample drawn in 1988 may be due to the survey redesign rather than actual changes in hospital utilization.;Type: ODUM:CODEBOOK.NUMBER Notes: 47-125-1990-CD;Type: ODUM:SOURCE.OF.DATA Notes: \"The National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) covers discharges from noninstitutional hospitals, exclusive of Federal, military, and Veterans Administration hospitals, located in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Only short-stay hospitals (those with an average length of stay for all patients of less than 30 days) or those whose specialty is general (medical or surgical) or children's general are included in the survey. These hospitals must also have six or more beds staffed for patient use. These criteria, used since the survey redesign in 1988, differ slightly from those used under the old design. Prior to 1988, hospitals with an average length of stay of 30 days or more were excluded, regardless of specialty. However, the term \"\"short-stay\"\" continues to be used because 98 percent of the hospitals in the NHDS universe fall into this category.\";"
