When patients in treatment fail to return at appropriate times for consultations and/or resupply of medication, community based organizations (CBOs) linked with the health facility deploy community workers (known as \u201c<i>activistas</i>\u201d) to locate those patients, counsel them and assist them in returning to the facility to recommence treatment. <br/><br/> This <i>busca activa</i> sy\nstem typically requires <i>activistas</i> to travel long distances to receive the names of patients in their community, return to their communities to search for the patient, and then once again return back to the health facility to complete the search \u2013 a search which often leads to dead-ends or difficulty reaching the patient. To improve the <i>busca activa</i> process, Clinical HIV/AIDS Services Strengthening in Sofala, Manica, and Tete (CHASS SMT) and Community Care Program (PCC) collaborate\nd with the technology firm Dimagi on a pilot in Beira, Sofala Province using mobile phones to follow-up on patients who have defaulted on their antiretroviral treatment (ART), have missed appointments or lab test dates.\n<br/><br/> <b>Study Purpose:</b> MEASURE Evaluation aimed to answer the following questions based on stakeholder (i.e., CHASS SMT, PCC, USAID/Mozambique) information needs: <ol><li>What was the process for rolling-out the mobile telephone approach? How was the approach perceived by key informants and how did the process has change throughout implementation;</li> <li>How many defaulted patients were searched for and returned to treatment during the pilot? How long did the process take? and</li> <\nli>What was the overall cost of the pilot? What was the cost per person searched for and per person returned to treatment in the first two months of implementation?\n</li></ol> <br/><br/> <b>Methodology:</b> In order to answer the questions, MEASURE Evaluation conducted three separate activities, including: <ol><li>A qualitative time series study of the mHealth roll-out with key stakeholders implementing the mHealth intervention;</li> <li>Secondary data analysis of mHealth busca activa variables such as the time between when a patient defaults, when a patient is searched for, and when they return to the health facility; and</li> <li>Expenditure analysis of t\nhe mHealth intervention based on eight months of start-up and implementation.\n</li></ol>"
