The print version has been published since 1878, and a compact disc version has been available since 1993. Both are designed to serve as a convenient, easy-to-use statistical reference source and guide to statistical publications and sources. Software on the disc can be used to perform full-text searches, view official statistics\n, open tables as Lotus worksheets or Excel workbooks, and link directly to source agencies and organizations for supporting information. The disc contains over 1,500 tables from over 250 different governmental, private, and international organizations. Topics include population; vital statistics; health and nutrition; education; law enforcement, courts and prison; geography and environment; elections; state and local government; federal government finances and employment; national defense and veterans affairs; social insurance and human services; labor force, employment, and earnings; income, expenditures, and wealth; prices; business enterprise; science and technology; agriculture; natural resources; energy; construction and housing; manufactures; domestic trade and services; transportation; information and communication; banking, finance, and insurance; arts, entertainment, and recreation; accommodation, food services, and other services; foreign commerce and aid; outlying areas; and comparative international statistics. The most significant change in the 2001 data is in the number and order of the sections. New items include 120 new tables; a new section on Accommodation, Food Services, and Other Services; new data from the 2000 Census found in many tables in the Population and Construction and Housing Sections; and results from the 2000 national elections available in the Elections section. The disc includes content not found in the book such as Adobe Acrobat PDFs providing more explanation of several major economic series in\ncluding the federal budget, the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), and the new North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Other PDFs provide information on the federal court system and social security. Links to these supplemental materials are provided from each appropriate table or from the text beginning the appropriate sections. The disc also includes new maps for reference from many different agencies including world and international maps from the Central Intelligence Agency and energy related maps from the Energy Information Administration. Other maps include maps of each state and their metro areas and component counties, congressional districts, national park sites throughout the country, U.S. transportation facilities and routes, coal mines and facilities, and the distribution of forest land.\"\n</p><p>Note to Users: This CD is part of a collection located in the Data Archive of the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
