Other partners in this effort include Population Services International (PSI), BRAC, Concerned Women for Family Development (CWFD), Population Services and Training Center (PSTC), Shimantik, and EngenderHealth.\r\n<br></br> The goal of the Marketing Innovation for Health program is to contribute to sustained improvements in the health status of women and children in Bangladesh by increasing access to and demand for these health products and services. An outcome evaluation will examine changes taking place in key outcomes in terms of utilization of health and family planning products and services. The evaluation measures outcomes \u201cbefore and after\u201d the intervention in project areas relative to changes in comparison areas. This dataset contains data that were collected from married women of reproductive age (MWRA) at the baseline, in 2013-2014 (n=6,662 MWRA from the intervention areas and n=6,791 MWRA from comparison areas). Endline data will be collected after about two years from the date of the baseline data collection.<br></br>\r\n<b>[RESTRICTED DATA]</b> <br></br> <b>MEASURE Evaluation Restricted Data Request Process</b> <br></br> The documentation is publicly accessible, but the data files are available only upon request.
