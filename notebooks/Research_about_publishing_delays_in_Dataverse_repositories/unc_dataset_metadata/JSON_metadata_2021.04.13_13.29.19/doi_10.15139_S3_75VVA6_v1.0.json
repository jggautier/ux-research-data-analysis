(Pre-lab baseline measures were completed by N = 134 people.)\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParticipants were eligible if they were at least 24 years old, cohabiting with the romantic partner, not taking antidepressants or been recently diagnosed with depression or an anxiety disorder; women were ineligible if they were over 40, postmenopausal, pregnant (or planning to become pregnant during the study), within 6 months postpartum (lactating), or have had an oopherectomy; men were ineligible if they were taking steroid medication. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn average, participants were 29 years old (range 23 \u2013 53), had been involved in their romantic relationship for more than 5 years; the majority were married (58%) or engaged to be married (11%). Most identified as White/Caucasian (78.4%) and non-Hispanic (99%).\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParticipants independently completed a 30 minute online questionnaire in the days prior to their first lab session. The couple attended the lab session together. There, we took baseline recordings of physiological activity while they independently completed a few well-being measures. Participants were then randomly assigned to have one of two types of structured conversations: express gratitude to the partner for something the partner had done for them, or discussion of their day so far (i.e., mundane things their partner might not have heard about yet; \u201cEvents of the day\u201d conversation). The structure of the task was as follows: couple-members independently took a couple of minutes to consider what they would discuss; then one couple-member led a conversation on the assigned topic, which was immediately followed by brief online questionnaires independently completed by each person; the 2nd couple-member then led a conversation and they again independently completed brief online questionnaires about it. Psychophysiology was assessed during each conversation and a small saliva sample was collected after each conversation. At the end of the lab session, the couple learned more about the tasks for the forthcoming month.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next month (28 nights), couple-members independently completed a brief nightly questionnaire about their day (including personal well-being and interactions with the partner). In addition, they were told they would be randomly signaled a handful of times in the morning (i.e., receive an email) prompting them to set aside time that evening to have a conversation on the general topic they had discussed in the lab (e.g., express gratitude for something new or discuss the events of the day, respectively). (Couples completed 5 such conversations, on average, over the month.) They independently completed brief online questionnaires about those conversations by the next morning.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour weeks after the first lab session, the couple returned to the lab and completed the same measures and procedures as well as compliance, willingness to be recontacted, and consent to use transcripts and videos/images in various contexts in the future.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill IRB #09-0409"

Her considerations for collaboration include feasibility, novelty, and potential impact of the work. Out of consideration for you and other collaborators, she may decline or postpone the start of a potential collaboration due to prior obligations. Her expectation is that she or Dr. Fredrickson will be given the opportunity to participate in the planning, analysis, and writeup of any papers, and will be authors unless they choose not to be. Any student interested in the data must have support and mentorship from their primary advisor. We do not have ethics approval to post these data online. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many more measures in the dataset than this form allows us to list. Please look at the attached Summary of Measures file for more information.
