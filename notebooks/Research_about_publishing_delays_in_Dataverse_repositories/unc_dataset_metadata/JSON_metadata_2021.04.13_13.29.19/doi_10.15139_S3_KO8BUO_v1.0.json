Some participants were in costumes of fictional anime characters. Daters attending the speed-dating event were invited to participate in the study, and nearly all agreed.  <br> <br>\r\n\r\nAttendees went on 13\u201315 3-min dates with participants of the opposite gender. Women remained seated while men rotated to the next date. Participants ranged in age from 18-30. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE QUESTIONNAIRES VARIED slightly between the samples, and hence the number of participants available depends on your research question. Please see attached excel file for a list of questionnaires and approximate sample size for each <br> <br>\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the event, participants completed a pre-survey with several demographic and individual difference measures (e.g., attachment, Big 5, destiny/growth, Sociosexual Inventory, Fear of Being Single, anticipated reactions to rejection/acceptance, motivations for speed-dating, approach/avoidance motivations, menstrual cycle information, etc.). Their photos were taken prior to the event commencing. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nThen after each date during the speed-dating event, participants responded to a questionnaire reflecting their impressions of that dater (e.g., physical attractiveness, how selective the dater is, self-expansion motivation, perceptions of attachment style, perceptions of partner's interest, etc.). Importantly, each dater indicated whether or not they would like to share their contact information (when both daters mutually agree to share contact information, this is considered a \"match\".) <br> <br>\r\n\r\nA few hours after the event, participants received their matches. In two samples (2013) they received a brief survey asking their positive and negative emotions regarding their matches, rejections, and missed opportunities. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nIn one sample (2015), participants were followed up every week for 12 weeks, to assess whether they had made contact with their matches, and track any budding relationships. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nThis study was approved by the ethics board of the University of Toronto."
