Acceptance of this Agreement</b><br><br>\r\nBy downloading or otherwise accessing the Materials, Downloader represents his/her acceptance of the terms of this Agreement. If downloading or otherwise accessing the Materials on behalf of an organization, company, institution, or entity, Downloader represents and warrants that he or she has actual authority to enter into this agreement on behalf of such organization, company, institution, or entity. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>II.

A community-based cross sectional cluster survey was organized in the Garoua Boulai health district (East Region, Cameroon) where no ivermectin mass administration was ever performed. The prevalence of loiasis was 8.0% (95% CI: 7.2 \u2013 9.0) and was quite different from one cluster to another (Minimum: 0.0%; Maximum: 43.5%). Onchocerciasis was found to be hypo-endemic (rate of exposure: 4.9%; 95% CI: 4.2 \u2013 5.7), and the endemicity of LF was quite low (prevalence: 0.4%; 95% CI: 0.2 \u2013 0.7). The likelihood of finding more than 1% of individuals harboring Loa mf densities higher than 20,000 mf/mL in a cluster was positively associated with the prevalence of loiasis, although a clear prevalence cut off is yet to be computed."
