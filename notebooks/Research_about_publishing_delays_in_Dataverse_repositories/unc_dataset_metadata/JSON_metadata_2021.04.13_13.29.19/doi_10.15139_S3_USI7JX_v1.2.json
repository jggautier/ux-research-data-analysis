Supported by the MasterCard Foundation, and implemented in Colombia, Ghana, Kenya, and Nepal, YouthSave was led by Save the Children in partnership with the Center for Social Development at Washington University in St. Louis (CSD), New America, and the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP). Ghana was selected as the site for the YouthSave\u2019s large-scale, experimental study and impact assessment.  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGhana was selected as the site for YouthSave's experimental study and impact assessment. Conducted by a team of researchers from the United States and Ghana, the Ghana Experiment investigated the viability of youth savings accounts and their potential effects on youth development outcomes, including financial, economic, education, health, and psychosocial well-being. The experiment sought to address critical gaps in research, knowledge, and practice in the field of youth financial inclusion in low and middle-income countries. The Ghana experiment was implemented in partnership with HFC Bank, the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) at University of Ghana, and the Global Social Development Innovations (GSDI) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ghana Experiment used a multi-stage sampling and a cluster randomized design with two treatment conditions and one control condition. Additionally, 50 schools were randomly assigned to the treatment conditions, and the other 50 schools to the control condition. Among the 50 treatment schools, 25 schools were randomly assigned to treatment condition 1 (i.e., savings account marketing outreach), and the other 25 schools to treatment condition 2 (i.e., in-school banking services plus marketing outreach). The sample comprised an initial cohort of 6,252 and an additional cohort of 2,000 junior high school students and their parents. For the original cohort, at least 60 to 62 students were randomly selected from each school to participate in the study. For the new cohort, at least 20 students were randomly selected from each school. Baseline data were collected from the original cohort in August 2011 and the new cohort in September 2013. Follow-up data collection happened for both cohorts from July to August 2014.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mandate from the central bank of Ghana, HFC Bank created a tailored youth savings account targeted to youth aged 12 to 18 years and operated as a custodial account. The account was to marketed to schools in treatment condition 1 and 2. Additionally, students in treatment condition 2 were allowed make school-based savings deposits.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee publication: Chowa, G., Masa, R., Osei-Akoto, I., Ansong, D., Despard, M., Afranie, S., ...
