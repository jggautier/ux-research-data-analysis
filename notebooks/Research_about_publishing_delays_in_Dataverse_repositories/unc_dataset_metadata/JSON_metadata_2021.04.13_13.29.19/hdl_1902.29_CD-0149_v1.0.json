When fully implemented, the ACS will collect data from a sample of approximately three million households each year, in every county, American Indian and Alaska Native area, Hawaiian Home Land, and in Puerto Rico. The Census 2000 Supplementary Survey (C2SS) is a decennial census program designed to demonstrate the feasibility of collecting long-form type\ninformation at the same time as, but separate from, the decennial census. The Supplementary Surveys used the questionnaire and methods developed for the ACS to collect demographic, social, economic, and housing data. The 2000-2001 Supplementary Survey, American Community Survey Test Sites CD-ROM features information from a sample of approximately 700,000 addresses in 1239 counties and 22 diverse test sites studied in 2000. Thirty-one sites are being studied in the comparison phase of the American Community Survey. Twenty-two sites with populations of 65,000 or more are published on this CD-ROM. The remainder of the 31 test sites is smaller areas, and will be published over time, using multi-year averages. Data from the Supplementary Surveys for 2000 and 2001 for the country; the 50 states; Washington, DC; and counties, cities, and metropolitan areas with 250,000+ population are included for the first time. Public Use Microdata Sample files for the Supplementary Surveys at the state level are also included in this edition. For the first time, two years of data are available on this CD-ROM which allows users to make comparisons between the two years.\"\n</p><p>Note to Users: This CD is part of a collection located in the Data Archive of the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
