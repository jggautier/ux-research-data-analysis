The data is provided to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program by the registration offices of all States, the District of Columbia, and New York City. Data from New York, excluding New York City, were submitte\nd in machine readable form. All other 1989 data were coded and keyed by the US Bureau of the Census. Fetal death data are limited to deaths occurring within the United States to U.S. residents and nonresidents. Fetal deaths occurring to U.S. citizens outside the United States are not included in this data file. In NCHS tabulations by place of residence, fetal deaths to nonresidents of the United States are excluded. The foreign resident records can be identified by code 4 in tape location 7 of the data tape. In addition, the majority of fetal death tables published by NCHS include only those fetal deaths with stated or presumed gestation of 20 weeks or more (see the Technical Appendix). Those records identified with a 2 in tape location 5 are included in these tabulations. All other records are excluded. Effective January 1, 1989, a revised U.S. Standard Report of Fetal Death replaced the 1978 revision. The 1989 revision provides a wide variety of new information on maternal and fetal health characteristics. Questions on complications of labor and delivery and congenital anomalies of fetus were changed from an open-ended question to a checkbox format to improve reporting of information. Several new items were added that improve the data files value for monitoring and research of factors affecting fetal mortality. NCHS has adopted a new policy on release of vital statistics unit record data files. This new policy is being implemented for the 1989 vital event files to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of individuals and institutions. As a result, this file does not contain the actual day of the death. The geographic detail is also restricted-only counties, cities, and SMSAS of 100,OOO or m\nore population based on the 1980 Census are identified.
