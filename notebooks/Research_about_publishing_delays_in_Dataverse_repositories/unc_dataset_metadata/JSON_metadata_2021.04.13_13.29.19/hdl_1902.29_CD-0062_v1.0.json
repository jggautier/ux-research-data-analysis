The Abstract has been published since 1878 while the compact disc version first appeared in 1993. Each is designed to serve as a convenient, easy-to-use statistical reference source and guide to statistical publications and sources. Both contain over 1,400 tables from almost 300 different governmental, private, and international o\nrganizations. What's New for 2000 The Census has updated most of the more than 1,500 tables and charts that were on the previous disc with new or more recent data. The spreadsheet files, which are available in both Excel and Lotus formats, will usually have more information than the tables displayed in the book or Adobe Acrobat files. This year the Census introduced almost 100 new tables covering a wide range of subject areas. The Census reinstated a smaller version of the Industrial Outlook Section (now 31) and has included a separate section (32) with 21 summary industry tables from the 1997 Economic Census based on the North American Industry Classification system (NAICS). Other new tables cover such topics as prescription drug sales, public school building conditions, charter schools, distance education, HMOs, income-tested benefits, employment projections, household debt, mutual fund ownership, commercial industry space revenue, hazardous material shipments, bridge conditions, home remodeling, firearms manufactures, and e-commerce sales. For a complete list of new tables, see Appendix VI. The disc also includes content not found in the book such as a special new section featuring early population results from the 2000 census for states, metropolitan areas, large cities, and counties. PDFs providing more explanation of several major economic series including the Federal Budget, the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), and the new North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Another PDF provides information\non the Federal court system. Links to these supplemental materials are provided from each appropriate table. Maps of each state and their metro areas and component counties, maps outlining National Park sites throughout the country, a map of the United States with major transportation facilities and routes, a U.S. map locating coal mines and facilities, and one depicting the distribution of forest land.\n</p><p>Note to Users: This CD is part of a collection located in the Data Archive of the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
