All participants were phoned or skyped before participation to ensure that they were in a relationship and currently living with their partner, as well as to ensure that they were fluent in English and that they understood the study.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nData from three couples were discarded because their time stamps indicated that one person was completing both couple members\u2019 surveys. The final sample consists of 57 couples, with an average age of 25 years (range = 18 to 47), and an average relationship length of 32 months (range = 2 months to 10 years).\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouples first completed a background survey that took about 30 minutes to complete.\r\nCouples chose a day of the week that was particularly good for them to complete surveys on (e.g., Sundays). Each couple started the two-week diary study on the day they selected. They completed 15 daily diaries total. On days 1, 8, and 15, participants also completed a longer \u201cweekly\u201d survey. So for example, a couple who chose Sunday as their preferred day would complete the weekly survey on three Sundays in a row, with daily diaries completed every day. On weekly days, participants first completed the weekly survey followed by that day\u2019s diary.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, we have data at background, daily, and weekly levels for both actor and partner. On average, participants completed 13.08 out of 15 diaries, and 2.83 of 3 weekly surveys.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthics Protocol Reference #29835"

You write an analysis plan, send it to me for feedback, and preregister it. <br>\r\n3. I send you the data, and you test your hypotheses as planned. <br>\r\n4.
