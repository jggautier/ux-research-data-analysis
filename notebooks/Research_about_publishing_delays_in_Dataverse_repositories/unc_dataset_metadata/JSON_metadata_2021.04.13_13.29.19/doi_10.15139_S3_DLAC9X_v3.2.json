Traditionally, safety and injury analysis has occurred in siloed fields, with road safety researchers relying predominately on police-recorded crash reports, and public health researchers relying on hospitalization records. Depending on the context of the study and the database used, findings vary. This is the case for the micro-level (e.g., injury severity of an individual) to the macro-level (e.g., injury rate) scale.\r\n\r\nThis project begins to map disparate data sets to inform questions surrounding crashes. The data-mapping process will aim to build linkages between police-crash datasets and other datasets (i.e., incident-oriented data, spatial data, emerging datasets) and scale it up to larger geographic areas. Efforts to augment crash data are not new. A notable health-oriented example which sought to link health and police records was the Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System (CODES). Although this federal program ended in 2013, some states, including California, North Carolina, and Tennessee, have continued this effort.\r\n\r\nAdded data and analytics resulted in a more \u201ccomplete picture\u201d of crashes and injuries. This complete picture enables researchers to improve their modeling, assist policy makers, and contribute to visualization that helps tell compelling safety stories that guide safety improvements. \r\n"

These residential locations have also been associated with demographic data from the US Census (i.e. population, race, age, etc.), as well as accessibility data. The accessibility data are calculated based on the Charlotte-Mecklenberg area\u2019s regional travel demand model. Accessibility to three kinds of destinations is calculated for travel by auto mode: accessibility to job locations, accessibility to common non-work locations (i.e. schools), and accessibility to the total population of the region.",
