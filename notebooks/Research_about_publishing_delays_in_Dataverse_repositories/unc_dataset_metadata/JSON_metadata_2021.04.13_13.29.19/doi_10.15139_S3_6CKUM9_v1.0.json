The base sample includes 140 participants in midlife (average age, 43 years) who were married for an average of 13 years and separated, on average, within the last 4 months. For various measures and timepoints, data is missing on about 13% of the sample. <p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is a study of individuals over time as they adapt to their marital separation and divorce. We collected self-reported data on five monthly assessments, and participants wore the EAR and sleep actigraphs on months 1,3, and 5. The EAR data is fully coded and includes the objective assessment of many daily social behaviors, including time spent alone, with others and/or socializing, time receiving social support, and time with an ex-partner. <p>\r\n<p>\r\nA detailed procedure manual for this study can be found here: \r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/i4ub012rod96wjo/DSE%20Procedure%20Manual%206.19.15.pdf?dl=0 <p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe complete Time 1 self-report measure set can be found here:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ccisc64skbbgksr/DSE%20Questionnaire%20Set%20Final.pdf?dl=0<p>\r\n<p>\r\nAn illustrative paper using this data can be found here:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pnwwbug4pk7dd8m/CPS%20Final%20Accepted%20Version.pdf?dl=0<p>\r\n<p>\r\nAll aspects of this study were approved by the University of Arizona IRB: #1100000370: Sleep and Divorce: Identifying Bidirectional Vulnerability and Resilience"

Our \"in press\" paper is one of the first to emerge from this data set and although we have several more at various stages of preparedness, this study is a gold mine for potential collaborations. <p>\r\nWe expect that any applications for collaboration will have a built-in plan for promoting open science, including wherever and whenever possible, preregistering planned analyses as part of our formal data use agreement: https://www.dropbox.com/s/cdo90c3aihvbvnp/DSE%20Data%20Use%20Guidelines_Nov%207_2016.docx?dl=0\r\n<p>\r\nIn general, we expect all potential outside collaborators to have the statistical and data analysis wherewithal to conduct the analyses that they propose for the existing data-- in other words, beyond reasonable expectations for a basic paper collaboration, we do not have extensive statistical support infrastrcture, although Mehl and Sbarra are both very willing to provide consultation on any given paper.\r\n<p>\r\nIn terms of authorship, Sbarra and Mehl will appear on all study paper, and any paper that includes EAR data will include Dr. Allison Tackman, a prior post-doc on the study who coordinated and finalized all aspects of the EAR coding.\r\n<p>\r\nSbarra and Mehl have a long history of collaboration and to being open to a variety of collaborative efforts from qualified investigators-- students, post-docs, or faculty. \r\n<p>\r\nThis a unique and exciting data set, and we hope you'll apply for funds to work with us.
