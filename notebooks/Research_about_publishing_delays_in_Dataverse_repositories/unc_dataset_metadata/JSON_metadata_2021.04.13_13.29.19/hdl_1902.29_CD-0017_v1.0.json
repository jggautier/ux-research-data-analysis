Summary data are provided on number of employees for the mid-March pay period, first-quarter total payroll, total annual payroll, number of establishments, and the number of establishments by employment-size class. Data are\ntabulated by detailed industry based on the 1987 edition of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) manual. The employment data obtained from administrative records of the Internal Revenue Service since 1978 differ somewhat from previously published employment data, in that all persons employed by an establishment filing a Treasury Form 941 are included in the County Business Patterns program. Although Form 941 is used only by employers covered (at least partially) by FICA, the data also include individual employees of the same establishment who are themselves not covered by FICA. In past years, employees of this type were not included. The difference in employment coverage will affect only certain types of activities, notably those where retirement systems other than Social Security are provided, or where part-time employees are prevalent. Examples would include hospitals and educational institutions. Administrative data for employees of establishments totally exempt from FlCA are excluded as are data for self-employed persons. The file provides data on total number of establishments, mid-March employment, first quarter and annual payroll, and number of establishments by employment-size classes. Whereas data in County Business Patterns reports are not shown for SIC's with fewer than 50 employees in a given area, there is no such restriction on the data files. This series excludes governmental establishments classified in the covered industries except for liquor stores and wholesale liquor establishments operated by State and local governments. All government hospitals are included beginning with 1989 data.\n</p><p>Note to Users: This CD is part of a collection located in the Data Archive of the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
