A female rat who has recently given birth (the \u201cTarget Dam\u201d) chooses between two groups of pups.  The experiment takes place in a chamber which accommodates the target dam, and has two cups (the left and right \u201csides\u201d) for the two groups of newborn rats.  Each group comprises four pups: two males and two females, all from the same mother.  (The Target Dam is never the Pup Dam (biological mother) on days PPD1 or PPD3, but the Target Dam can be the same as the Pup Dam on day PPD5.)    The two groups always have different mothers.  Thus, there are eight pups and the Target Dam in each experiment. The test day (DAY) is the post-partum day of the Target Dam and the Pup Dam. In other words, it is the number of days the Target Dam has been a mom, and the age in days of the pups. NOTE: The pups in this experiment were also used in Experiment 4, which analyzed their vocalizations. The Target Dam, having recently given birth, engages in the usual maternal behavior of herding the pups together against her body for feeding.  A common behavior is for the Target Dam to grab a pup by the scruff of the neck and carry it back to the main room.  The TD carries one pup at a time, but can go back for more pups.  Zero to four pups from each group can be moved in this fashion. The behavior of the TD is videotaped for later coding by Sarah and/or undergraduates.  A fancy computer recording setup lets the coders easily record the observed behaviors by clicking on buttons.  Several TD behaviors are recorded: 1.\t  RETRIEVE ONE PUP FROM THE LEFT CHAMBER.  This button is pressed when the TD fetches a single pup. (NOTE: If that pup is the fourth pup\u2014the last remaining pup in the chamber\u2014the observer presses the RETRIEVE ONE PUP FROM THE RIGHT CHAMBER button instead.)  2.\tRETRIEVE ONE PUP FROM THE RIGHT CHAMBER. 3.\tRETRIEVE ALL PUPS FROM THE LEFT CHAMBER.   Pressed when the TD fetches the fourth (and last) pup from the left chamber. 4.\tRETRIEVE ALL PUPS FROM THE RIGHT CHAMBER.   5.\tHEAD IN LEFT.  The TD sticks her head in the enclosed left cup.  The cup is shielded from view of the camera, so we can\u2019t see how she interacts with the pups in there until she fetches one out. 6.\tHEAD IN RIGHT. 7.\tCROUCH.  The TD nurses a retrieved pup or pups. 8.\tTOUCH.  The TD touches a retrieved\r\npup. 9.\tLICK.  The TD licks a retrieved pup. 10.\tGROUP.  The TD puts the pups in a group (by picking one up and moving it into the huddle).  The TD can group a newly retrieved pup that has escaped, or she can re-group a previously grouped pup now straying off.  When the TD retrieves a pup, she has the choice of adding the pup to the huddle of other pups (\u201cgrouping\u201d it) or setting it down outside the huddle. 11.\tOTHER.  Another behavior, such as walking around the cage and not interacting with the pups. Treatments.  Both the Target Dam and the pups have been assigned to treatments (sometimes called exposures).  While pregnant, the TD may have been exposed to Cocaine (CC), exposed to saline (CS) or left untreated (UN).  Both the CC and CS treatments use syringes to deliver the medication.  Nothing is done for the UN treatment.    The treatments for the pups are similar, but are given not to the pups directly, but to their mother while pregnant with the litter.   Different experiments are done on three days: 1.\t Day 1 post partum  (the day of the pups\u2019 birth).  The TD chooses between pups from two other mothers (never her own pups).  One group is CC and the other is always UN.  (The mother of the four pups in one group was cocaine treated, and the mother of the pups in the other group was untreated.) 2.\tDay 3 is the same set-up as Day 1. 3.\tDay 5.  The TD chooses between her own pups and pups from another mother.  One of three set-ups is used: a.\tAn UN TD chooses between her own pups and pups from a CC mom. b.\tA CS TD chooses between her own pups and pups from a CC mom. c.\tA CC TD chooses between her own pups and pups from a UN mom.
