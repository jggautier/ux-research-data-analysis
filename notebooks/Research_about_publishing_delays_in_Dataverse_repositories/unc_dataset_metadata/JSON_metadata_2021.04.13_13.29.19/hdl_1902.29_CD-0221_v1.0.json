The data is provided to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program by the registration offices of all States, the District of Columbia, and New York City. Data from New York, excluding New York City, were submitte\nd in machine readable form. All other 1992 data were coded and keyed by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Fetal death data are limited to deaths occurring within the United States to U.S. residents and nonresidents. Fetal deaths occurring to U.S. citizens outside the United States are not included in this data file. In NCHS tabulations by place of residence, fetal deaths to nonresidents of the United States are excluded. The foreign resident records can be identified by code 4 in tape location 7 of the data tape. In addition, the majority of fetal death tables published by NCHS include only those fetal deaths with stated or presumed gestation of 20 weeks or more (see the Technical Appendix). Those records identified with a 2 in tape location 5 are included in these tabulations. All other records are excluded. Effective January 1, 1989, a revised U-S. Standard Report of Fetal Death replaced the 1978 revision. The 1989 revision provides a wide variety of new information on maternal and fetal health characteristics. Questions on complications of labor and delivery and congenital anomalies of fetus were changed from an open-ended question to a checkbox format to improve reporting of information. Several new items were added that improve the data files value for monitoring and research of factors affecting fetal mortality. The Office of Management and Budget revised its designation of metropolitan statistical areas based on figures from the 1990 Census. Effective with the 1990 data file, NCHS has been using these new definitions and codes as indicated in the listing of 320 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAS), Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAS), and New England County Metropolitan Ar\neas (NEaSS) included in this documentation. There are also 20 Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (mSAS), which are made up of PMSAS. Other geographic changes based on the 1990 Census will be implemented later. NCHS has adopted a new policy on release of vital statistics unit record data files. This new policy was implemented with the 1989 vital event files to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of individuals and institutions. As a result, this file does not contain the actual day of the death. The geographic detail is also restricted-only counties and cities of 100,000 or more population based on the 1980 Census as well as metropolitan areas of 100,000 or more population based on the 1990 Census, are identified.
