The goal was to help build a knowledge base to inform future programs and policies to promote savings and accumulation of productive assets in sub-Saharan Africa. AssetsAfrica was conducted by researchers at the Global Social Development Innovations, in partnership with the Center for Social Development (CSD) at Washington University in St. Louis and Build Africa Uganda.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssetsAfrica used a nonequivalent groups design with pre and posttest. The study used purposive sampling. Half of the sample households were assigned to the treatment condition and the other half to the comparison condition. Baseline data were collected in August 2005 and a follow-up survey was conducted in September 2006. Data on participants\u2019 savings and withdrawal patterns were tracked and collated using an account monitoring software called MISIDA.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParticipants in the treatment group received (1) training in financial management and asset building, and (2) individual bank accounts with the Masindi branch of Stanbic Bank. Participants were expected to save into their accounts for at least six months before they were eligible for a match of 1:1. A household could receive a maximum matched fund of $285. After they reached their savings target and were matched, participants bought their desired assets (e.g., livestock, means of transport, house, land for agricultural use, and tools/equipment for small business start-ups), with the guidance of Build Africa Uganda and CSD.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee publication: Chowa, G., Masa, R., & Sherraden, M.
