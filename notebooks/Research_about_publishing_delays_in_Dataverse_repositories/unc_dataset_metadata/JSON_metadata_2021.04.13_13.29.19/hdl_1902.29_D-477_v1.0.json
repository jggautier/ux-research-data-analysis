Only the mass sample panel data will be described herein. Part one of the panel was intended to: 1) Provide the first stage of a study of change within a community and 2) Provide priority ranking of key variables. Part two of the panel was designed to accomplish multiple purposes: 1) to focus on issues shown to be of prominent concern in the first wave; 2) to determine the reception pattern for a mass-channeled \"\"information release\"\" effected between the first and second interview waves (the information release was a report of Wave I findings, with expanded information on the subject of drugs in the community which had been determined to be of great interest and consequently was chosen as the subject for the subsequent laboratory group stage of the study); and 3) to serve as a basis for recruiting participants for the laboratory groups. This comprehensive survey includes over 1300 variables which may be broken down into various categories: 1) \"\"individual life space\"\" which includes physical environment, mobility, age, sex, occupation, etc., 2) \"\"need satisfactions\"\" which includes homes, friends, work, polity, security, belonging and efficacy; 3) \"\"basic personality dimensions\"\" such as level of self- esteem, personality type, and determined values; 4) \"\"cognitive and strategic variables\"\" including dogmatism, selectivity, patterns, and preferred behavior strategies; 5) \"\"issues-related items\"\" including first, second, and third most important issues from a list of twenty- one; 6) political and group participation patterns; and 7) communication predilections.\"\n</p>"
