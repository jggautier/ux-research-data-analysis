The purpose of this initiative is to reward the skill and career development of frontline health and health care workers through innovative collaborations between employers, educational institutions, and other relevant stakeholders. Partnerships funded through this initiative  were comprised of health or health care employers across sectors, educational institutions (e.g., community colleges, 4 year colleges and independent training providers), and other community organizations (e.g., workforce investment boards, labor unions). Working in collaboration and using work-based learning, the partnerships seek to:  improve supervision, mentoring, wages, and benefits; support training and career ladders; and bolster human resource policies that support skill and career development for incumbent FLWs. In order to maximize the potential of the Jobs to Careers initiative, which involves  17 grantees with 3-year horizons, the UNC evaluation will be designed to include both formative and summative components for each project and will use a comparative case methodology to systematically extract and contextualize lessons learned and promising practices related to the primary areas of interest (e.g., work-based learning, career development, improved job quality, system change within partner organizations, leveraging partnership resources, and policy change) for the program."
