Additionally, participants must not have been recently diagnosed with anxiety or depression, nor could they be taking steroid medication; women were pre-menopausal, not currently pregnant or nursing, not pregnant in the prior six months, and had not had an oophorectomy.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn average, participants were about 24 years old (M = 23.6, SD = 5.41, range = 18 to 50), predominantly Caucasian (70.9%) and non-Hispanic (90.3%).\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParticipants screened in and consented to participate, independently, online prior to scheduling their appointment. Once scheduled, they picked up a urine collection kit at least 36 hours prior to their lab session. The day before they came to the lab, participants collected all urine their body produced for a 24 hour period. They also each independently completed a 30-45 minute online questionnaire.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arrival to the lab, experimenters received the participants\u2019 urine samples for processing, collected saliva for genotyping, participants provided baseline psychophysiological assessments and independently completed online well-being questionnaires. They then received instructions for the expressed gratitude task, independently selected a topic, in separate rooms privately used a webcam to record an expression of gratitude to the partner, received instructions for the in-person expressed gratitude conversation, had the conversation (back in the same room), and independently completed questions about it. Note that only one member of the couple expressed gratitude to the partner in person and that expresser had been randomly assigned to condition.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the main task, participants were separated; five minutes of time sitting together on the couch after voluntary reunion was videorecorded.

Her considerations for collaboration include feasibility, novelty, and potential impact of the work. Out of consideration for you and other collaborators, she may decline or postpone the start of a potential collaboration due to prior obligations. Her expectation is that she or a member of her team will be given the opportunity to participate in the planning, analysis, and writeup of any papers, and will be authors unless they choose not to be.
