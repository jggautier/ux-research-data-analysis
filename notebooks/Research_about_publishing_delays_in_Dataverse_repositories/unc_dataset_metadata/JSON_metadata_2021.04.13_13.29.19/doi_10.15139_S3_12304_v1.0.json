Dams are given the opportunity to choose between two alleys and the greater proportion of time spent in an alley is interpreted as a preference for that olfactory stimulus.  The left and right alleys will have alternating urine types across the test days, so that if UN urine was on the left on PPD1, UN urine will be on the right on PPD3.  This test is administered on Gestational Day 19, and immediately before the Retrieval Test on Post-Partum Days 1, 3, and 5.  All Target Dams should have both Olfactory and Retrieval data on all days. \t This experiment uses the same test fixture used by the Retrieval Experiment, but in with slightly different procedures.  There are two alleys and a central compartment.  The DISTAL part of the alley is FARTHEST from the swab (closest to the central compartment); the PROXIMAL part of the alley is CLOSEST to the swab (and farthest from the central compartment).  A female rat who has recently given birth, or will give birth, (the \u201cTarget Dam\u201d) chooses between two cotton swabs containing traces of urine from another dam\u2019s pups.  The experiment takes place in a chamber which accommodates the target dam, and has two cups (the left and right \u201csides\u201d) for the two swabs of urine.
