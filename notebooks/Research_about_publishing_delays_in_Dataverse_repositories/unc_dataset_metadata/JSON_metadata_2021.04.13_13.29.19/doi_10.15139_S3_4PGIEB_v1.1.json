The PLACE method addresses the need for rapidly available information to strategically target and monitor local HIV prevention and treatment programming. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis study was designed to identify and map places where HIV transmission is most likely to occur in Haiti, to estimate the coverage of prevention services at those locations, and to characterize key populations in Haiti including estimating population size, prevalence, and risk factors for HIV. This dataset covers all 10 geographic departments of Haiti and includes 2,339 hot spots which were identified and mapped as well as interviews with female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), and transgender women (TGW).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n<b>[RESTRICTED DATA]</b> \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nLINKAGES Restricted Data Request Process \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe documentation and public-use data are accessible; however, restricted data files including HIV and STI test results are available upon request.
