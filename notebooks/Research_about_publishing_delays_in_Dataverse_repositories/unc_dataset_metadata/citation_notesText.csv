The fundamental redesign structure of the 1995-2004 NHIS is similar to that of the 1985-1994 NHIS; however, there were two major changes to the sampling design. First, a state-level stratification increased the number of primary sampling units (PSUs) from 198 to 358. This enhanced the capability of using the NHIS for state estimation and future dual-frame surveys at the state level. Users should note that the NHIS is currently not designed to provide state-level estimates; however, in some cases this can be done, particularly for those states with larger populations. Contact the NCHS Research Data Center for more information. Secondly, both the black and Hispanic populations are now oversampled to allow for more precise estimation of health in these growing minority populations.

A new sample was drawn in 1988, when a three-stage sampling plan was implemented and several data collection and estimation procedures were revised. The redesign of the survey is important, especially for those conducting trend analyses. Because the new surve
y differs from the original one in sample design, data collection, and estimation procedures, some of the differences between NHDS statistics based on the 1965-87 sample and statistics based on the sample drawn in 1988 may be due to the survey redesign rather than actual changes in hospital utilization.;Type: ODUM:CODEBOOK.NUMBER Notes: 47-125-2004-CD;Type: ODUM:SOURCE.OF.DATA Notes: ""The National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) covers discharges from noninstitutional hospitals, exclusive of Federal, military, and Veterans Administration hospitals, located in the 50 States and the District of Columbia.

These hospitals must also have six or more beds staffed for patient use. These criteria, used since the survey redesign in 1988, differ slightly from those used under the old design. Prior to 1988, hospitals with an average length of stay of 30 days or more were excluded, regardless of specialty.

The fundamental redesign structure of the 1995-2004 NHIS is similar to that of the 1985-1994 NHIS; however, there were two major changes to the sampling design. First, a state-level stratification increased the number of primary sampling units (PSUs) from 198 to 358. This enhanced the capability of using the NHIS for state estimation and future dual-frame surveys at the state level. Users should note that the NHIS is currently not designed to provide state-level estimates; however, in some cases this can be done, particularly for those states with larger populations. Contact the NCHS Research Data Center for more information. Secondly, both the black and Hispanic populations are now oversampled to allow for more precise estimation of health in these growing minority populations.

31458,https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/3KW1DB,,"<strong>Important note about source of payment for childbirth.</strong> Due to the abundance of options for health insurance coverage in California in 2016, <em>Listening to Mothers in California</em> Survey investigators were unsure whether survey participants with Medi-Cal (California’s Medicaid program) coverage, including many Medicaid managed care plans, would consistently be aware of Medi-Cal as the source of payment for their birth. Investigators thus arranged for the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) to identify survey participants with a 2016 Medi-Cal-paid childbirth claim in the DHCS Management Information System/Decision Support System (MIS/DSS) Warehouse. All initial survey data analyses (at <a href=""http://www.nationalpartnership.org/LTMCA"" target=""blank"">www.nationalpartnership.org/LTMCA</a>) and all secondary analyses by the investigator team use this “gold standard” identifier for participants who had Medi-Cal coverage for childbirth. The investigators went to great effort to be able to include this identifier in the public dataset, and received no response from DHCS. The Dataverse dataset therefore does not include this identifier. It does include participants’ self-reports of source of payment for their childbirth, and the Kappa score of agreement between Medi-Cal-paid claim in MIS/DSS Warehouse and the women’s self-reports is 0.81. Thus, there may be some discrepancies between analyses carried out by investigators and by users of the public dataset using the source of payment variable.
<br></br>
The investigators also have access to selected items from participants’ birth certificates, and are prohibited from including any birth-certificate-derived items in the public dataset."

A new sample was drawn in 1988, when a three-stage sampling plan was implemented and several data collection and estimation procedures were revised. The redesig

Because the new survey differs from the original one in sample design, data collection, and estimation procedures, some of the differences between NHDS statistics based on the 1965-87 sample and statistics based on the sample drawn in 1988 may be due to the survey redesign rather than actual changes in hospital utilization.;Type: ODUM:CODEBOOK.NUMBER Notes: 47-125-1990-CD;Type: ODUM:SOURCE.OF.DATA Notes: ""The National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) covers discharges from noninstitutional hospitals, exclusive of Federal, military, and Veterans Administration hospitals, located in the 50 States and the District of Columbia.

These hospitals must also have six or more beds staffed for patient use. These criteria, used since the survey redesign in 1988, differ slightly from those used under the old design. Prior to 1988, hospitals with an average length of stay of 30 days or more were excluded, regardless of specialty.

Because the new survey differs from the original one in sample design, data collection, and estimation procedures, some of the differences between NHDS statistics based on the 1965-87 sample and statistics based on the sample drawn in 1988 may be due to the survey redesign rather than actual changes in hospital u

The original sample, drawn in 1965 and followed through 1987, was based on a two-stage sampling plan. A new sample was drawn in 1988, when a three-stage sampling plan was implemented and several data collection and estimation procedures were revised. The redesign of the survey is important, especially for those conducting trend analyses. Because the new surve
y differs from the original one in sample design, data collection, and estimation procedures, some of the differences between NHDS statistics based on the 1965-87 sample and statistics based on the sample drawn in 1988 may be due to the survey redesign rather than actual changes in hospital utilization.;Type: ODUM:CODEBOOK.NUMBER Notes: 47-125-2994-CD;Type: ODUM:SOURCE.OF.DATA Notes: ""The National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) covers discharges from noninstitutional hospitals, exclusive of Federal, military, and Veterans Administration hospitals, located in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Only short-stay hospitals (those with an average length of stay for all patients of less than 30 days) or those whose specialty is general (medical or surgical) or children's general are included in the survey. These hospitals must also have six or more beds staffed for patient use. These criteria, used since the survey redesign in 1988, differ slightly from those used under the old design. Prior to 1988, hospitals with an average length of stay of 30 days or more were excluded, regardless of specialty. However, the term """"short-stay"""" continues to be used because 98 percent of the hospitals in the NHDS universe fall into this category."";"

In each country, surveys were conducted with a cross-section of between 300 and 1,250 people aged 16 and above, and a separate sample of 50 leaders. The same questionnaire, translated in
to local languages, was used for each country and for both the public and leader samples. Sampling methodology varied from country to country and is described in greater detail in the accompanying report entitled: Public and Leadership Attitudes to the Environment in Four Continents. In most developed countries, the public sample was designed to be representative of all persons aged 16 and over. In most developing countries, the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas and urban centers, because of the impracticality of surveying rural populations. In some countries, the sample was drawn from electoral registers; in others, area probability samples were used. Other countries used """"random walk"""" techniques or quota samples. The method employed was generally the one most widely used for surveys of public opinion in that country. In Saudi Arabia, the sample was limited to men. The leadership samples were drawn from a designated list of elected and appointed officials, civil servants, news media, business, religious, trade union, and medical leaders. The number of interviews obtained within each category depended upon the relative importance of each group in the particular country.;Type: ODUM:ACCESS.CATEGORY Notes: I;Type: ODUM:CODEBOOK.NUMBER Notes: H-884002;"

For the supplementary materials, verification was performed solely for the successful execution of code. All of the manuscript's substantive results replicate successfully. Some minor discrepancies may appear when users attempt to replicate precisely the estimates from Table 4. This is caused by variations in the computing environment affecting the script's underlying random number generation. Authors have described the computing environment within which their original results were estimated, and Odum replicators have confirmed that discrepancies caused by this do not alter the empirical findings of the manuscript. The verification process was carried out by the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."
